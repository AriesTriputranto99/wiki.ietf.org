# Attestation Results Carrying Protocols and APIs

## RFCs

## Active Internet Drafts

* * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-teep-protocol/

## Documents in other Standards Development Organizations (SDO)

* [OPC UA](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part2/v104/docs/8) does not use TLS but its own protocol for authentication. There are prototypes that do attestation using certifications, such as the one discussed at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9886014 and also a [prototype done by Microsoft](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/04/24/trusted-cyber-physical-systems-looks-to-protect-your-critical-infrastructure-from-modern-threats-in-the-world-of-iot/) in 2018.
