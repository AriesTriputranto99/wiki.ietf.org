# Transport Area WG (TSVWG)

The Transport and Services WG works on mechanisms related to end-to-end data transport to support Internet applications and services that exchange potentially large volumes of traffic at potentially high bandwidths. A key focus are mechanisms to detect and react to congestion in the Internet, such as the congestion control algorithms in Internet transport control protocols such as TCP, QUIC, SCTP, MPTCP, and DCCP. The group also maintains and develops specifications for endpoint to network control mechanisms, Diffserv, QoS and reservation signaling, multipath extensions to existing transport protocols (when not protocol-specific), and extensions to the IETF protocols to support transport protocols (e.g., ECN).

The TSVWG receives occasional proposals for the development and publication of RFCs dealing with transport topics that are not in scope of an existing working group (e.g., NAT) and that does not justify the formation of a new working group. This working group provides a venue to progress such documents.

It is important to differentiate [TSVWG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tsvwg/documents/), which is a document-producing working group, from WITAREA, which is the area-wide meeting that the transport area regularly holds during IETF meetings. WITAREA does not produce any documents, and its purpose is to expose new developments related to web and Internet transport topics to the community.


# WIT AREA (Will be a separate page)

The WIT area intersects most frequently with Internet area, the applications area, the ART area, the security area and several IRTF research groups. The WIT Area includes what was previously called the "transport area" or "TSV area" - covers a range of technical topics related to data transport in the Internet. 

## Mailing List and Aliases
The area-wide mailing list of the web and Internet transport area is http://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/wit-area and the mailing list archive is at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/wit-area/.

Several other aliases offer convenient shortcuts to send email to various WIT Area people and community members:

- wit-ads@… reaches the current area directors
- wit-chairs@… reaches the current set of transport area WG chairs
- tsv-art@… reaches the current set of transport area review team members
- -chairs@… reaches the current chairs of the working group with abbreviation < WG >
- -ads@… reaches the current ADs of the working group with abbreviation < WG >

## Office Hours
The WIT area directors try to schedule office hours during each IETF plenary meeting, which allow anyone to drop in to discuss relevant topics. The time and place are usually announced on http://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/tsv-area before each meeting.


# Transport Area Review Team (TSVART) (Will be a separate page)

The Transport Area Review Team (TSVART) (or "[Transport Area Review Team](/group/tsv/TSVART)") is an advisory group of transport protocol experts selected by the WIT area directors. The area directors use feedback from the Area Review Team when making decisions on a range of topics related to Internet transport and the related IETF activities. More information about the tasks, members and activities of the TSV area review team can be found on the [TSVART](/group/tsv/TSVART) page.
