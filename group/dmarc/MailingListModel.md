# Mailing List Manager Modeling Exercise

Given an MLM model, we should be able to compare and contrast behaviors with some degree of consistency.

## Authentication

Using DKIM or SPF in order to authenticate posters is commonly neglected by MLM software. As a workaround, signing ML messages is among the few occurrences of end-user crypto that enjoy a noticeable diffusion. However, modern standards provide for hiding signatures inside MIME structures, which are typically altered by MLMs, so that MUAs can hardly display which parts are signed --it was better when it was worse.

DKIM and SPF validation options can be stored among a subscriber's preferences, setting their initial values on first use. â€‹DKIM&ML provides for non-authenticated messages to be held for moderation or rejected outright. None of the models below do so.

## Models
### SMTP compliant ML

[SMTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-3.9) distinguishes ML "explosion" from alias expansion. MLMs replace the Reverse-path in order to relief list posters from delivery details that they're not interested in, since they have no say on what addresses the list contains.

MLMs modify no other part of the envelope, and don't touch the content. That way, they are DMARC compatible (they just dis-align SPF).
### Classical ML

The "continuation in email transit" model provided by SMTP has been progressively driven into full blown MLMs, which perform additional, sometimes extensive, modifications to a message and its envelope. Typically:

|   part   |     field    |               content               |
|:--------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
|  tag     |  Subject:    |  List identifier                    |
|          |  To: or Cc:  |  the order of recipients may vary   |
|  footer  |  Body        |  List info, legal boilerplate       |
{.dense}

As DKIM was designed assuming SMTP compliance, Classical ML likely break signatures.
### BBS style mailings

These include forums and web-based groups as well as issue tracking systems. Posts can be addressed toward specific sections of a collective work. From: can be the poster's name and address; in that case, they have the same problem as Classical ML. It seems that an author's email address in From: is definitely more appealing than the list name.

### Dynamic lists

Another case is [dynamic lists](http://systers.org/wiki/doku.php/good_to_know), featuring well-defined threads. They change the address to listname+new@domain for new threads. They have the same problem as Classical ML, of course. The interesting point is their search for a new ML model.
### Ugly hack

Advent of DMARC and large mail domains obnoxiously publishing strong policies required some workaround. For example:

|      part      |  field  |                                                                             content                                                                             |
|:--------------:|:-------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  Domain        |  From:  |  If the original From:  domain publishes a strong DMARC policy, the domain is changed by  appending a different two (or more) extra labels to the domain name   |
|  other fields  |         |  See classical ML                                                                                                                                               |
{.dense}

Installation is DNS-intensive. The resulting behavior is uneven and difficult to understand.
### Publishing house metaphor

This is an untested idea, so it's described in greater detail. The point is not to convince anyone to marry it, but to show that it is possible to redesign a MLM anew, such that its behavior is coherent and uniform, yet minimizing changes. As the result is SMTP-compliant, DMARC won't hinder delivery.
