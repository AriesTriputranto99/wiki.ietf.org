NB: *homenet* mailing list not yet active, using *homegate* in the interim.

## Description of working group:

Home networks are used for communication among networked devices deployed within a home or home office, and for communication with the Internet at large. The manner in which a home network is used is evolving, at times resulting in interoperability and/or performance problems.

A home network can include a variety of data-link technologies, such as Ethernet, 802.11, 802.15.4 or power line communication. Connected devices may be as diverse as personal computers, televisions, digital video recorders, telephones, computing tablets, digital cameras, gaming consoles, audio output speakers, smart electricity meters, light switches, toys, printers, routers and more. The home network provides local connectivity, Internet connectivity through one or more Internet Service Providers, and connectivity to closed networks, such as corporate VPNs and walled garden services. Home networks offer unique challenges not only because of the wide range of devices, applications, and user types, but also because they are typically not actively managed.

The broad purpose of the home networking (HOMENET) working group is to describe the home network IP architecture and to work on clarifications and improvements to IETF protocols to allow the home network to better meet present and anticipated future requirements. The HOMENET working group will deliver recommendations related to the use of IETF-specified technologies such as TCP, IPv6, DNS, and IP routing protocols and will not overlap with specifications related to system-level or link-layer technologies developed by other standards bodies.

The working group will work together with other standards development organizations that define requirements and specifications on home networking devices (including groups such as the Home Gateway Initiative, Broadband Forum, CableLabs?, UPnP, DLNA, etc.).

Extensions to IETF technologies will typically occur in the relevant working groups chartered to maintain those technologies, based on recommendations and requirements from the HOMENET working group. When appropriate, the HOMENET working group itself may advance protocol specifications with close review from any affected working groups in the IETF.

The initial deliverable for the HOMENET working group is a Home Networking Architecture document. This document will define terminology, specific problem statements, and describe how various solution areas fit together. These areas include, but are not limited to:

  -  Routed home - automatic prefix assignment and distribution of other configuration information in a network with multiple routers, subnets and data link types. 

  -  Simple naming for entities in the home network, so they can be accessed from within the home network as well as from elsewhere on the Internet. 

 -   Support for connections to multiple Internet service providers or closed networks (VPNs, walled gardens) at the same time. 

  -  Effective queuing and forwarding mechanisms to enable efficient communication between network segments of different speeds, latencies and error rates. 

 -   Reasonable default network layer security in accordance with known and/or expected threats, while not hindering the deployment of new applications or transport layer protocols. 

 -   Support for DNSSEC validation within the home network. 

## Goals and Milestones:

Nov 2010 - Initial revision of a Home Network Architecture document
Mar 2011 - Adopt a Home Network Architecture document as a WG item
Mar 2011 - Individual drafts as WG candidates for Routed home requirements
Mar 2011 - Individual drafts as WG candidates for Simple naming requirements
Mar 2011 - Individual drafts as WG candidates for Multi-homing requirements
Mar 2011 - Individual drafts as WG candidates for QoS requirements
Mar 2011 - Individual drafts as WG candidates for Security requirements
Mar 2011 - Individual drafts as WG candidates for DNSSEC requirements
Jul 2011 - Recharter the working group
Dec 2011 - Submission of the Home Network Architecture document to the IESG
## Agenda for IETF79:

  1.  Blue sheets, etc - Chairs, 5m
  2.  Scope change - Chairs, 15m
  3.  Charter - Chairs, 20m
  4.  Home Network Architecture draft, 20m
  5.  Unsolved issues with IPv6 in the home, Ole Troan, 15m
