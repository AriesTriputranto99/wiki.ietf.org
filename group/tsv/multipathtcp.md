Multipath TCP is a proposed new IETF activity to add capability to use multiple connection paths in a single TCP connection. The availability of multiple connection paths and the capability to dynamically schedule traffic between them allows more flexibility and efficiency in Internet congestion control, in addition to other benefits, as discussed in the material below.

A Multipath TCP BOF is planned for IETF75.

Mailing list is available [here](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/MultipathTcp).
