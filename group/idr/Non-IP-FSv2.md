## 4. Adding Non-IP Filters and Actions to FSv2 

FSv2 (([draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-v2-03](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-v2/)) specified Non-IP filters for MPLS, SFC, L2VPN, and tunnels (using nvo3 concepts). 

Design team 4 will focus on FSv2 work on Actions and Filters for MPLS, SFC, L2VPNs, and Tunnels. The design team will examine previous work on MPLS, SFC, L2VPN, and tunnels and suggest implementation "chunks" to make it easier for developers. 

In addition, this design team will examine new filters and actions. 


**Design team:** Design Team 4 - Non-IP Filters and Actions    
**Meetings before IETF-120:** 5/13 and 6/17 (Time 11-12:00) ET) with Design Team 3 
**appropriate drafts:** Drafts proposing any Non-IP filters or Non-IP Actions 
**initial drafts:**  
1. draft-ietf-hares-fsv2-non-IP - This draft provides a starting point for FSv2 work included MPLS Filters and actions. 
  
2. [draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn](/group/idr/implementations/draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn) 
This IDR WG draft provides the L2 Filters and Actions. 

3.[draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-nv03](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-nvo3/)
  This IDR draft includes filtering of various headers of 
  L2 and L3 tunnels.  

4. [RFC9015](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9015/)
This draft provides the SFC flowspecification filters and actions. 




## reading 

**individual drafts for this team **:
1. [draft-xiong-idr-detnet-flow-mapping](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-xiong-idr-detnet-flow-mapping/) 
This draft provides L2 + latency filters and actions. 

2. [draft-zzd-flowspec-path-scheduling](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zzd-idr-flowspec-path-scheduling/)
Filtering and actions based on packet timing.
