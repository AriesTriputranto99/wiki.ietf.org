This page is intended to be a place to collect wisdom and advice regarding the interpretation of various working group documents. For documents that are still in draft, it's probably more appropriate to comment on the draft, so it can be revised, but for documents that are already RFC, this is an appropriate place to collect notes. Such notes might be things that would someday be integrated into a revised version of the RFC, if is ever published.

Readers should keep in mind that this is a wiki, and that the comments published here may not reflect working group consensus or indeed anything other than one individual's opinion at the moment they were written.

- [RFC 4271, BGP-4](/group/idr/rfc4271)
