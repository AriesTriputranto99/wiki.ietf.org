### Technical issues 

#### Issue-1.) Abstract changes to add [RFC9012]

> Old text:/
>    SR Policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more
>    segment lists and necessary path attributes.  It enables
>    instantiation of an ordered list of segments with a specific intent
>    for traffic steering.  DetNet provides the capability to carry
>    specified unicast or multicast data flows with extremely low data
>    loss rates and bounded end-to-end latency within a network domain.
>    This document defines the SR policy enhancement to carry the Bounded
>    Latency Information with a candidate path of SR policy.  So that BLI
>    behavior can be enabled automatically when the SR Policy is applied./

#### Issue-2. Sections 1-8 , needs to be updated to correct references. 

[draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] has been replace by [RFC9256]
[draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] has been replaced by 
[draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] and [draft-ietf-idr-sr-segtypes-ext].

#### Issue-3. Section 1, text needs to indicate what SR Policy is 

> Old text:/
>    Segment Routing Policy is defined
>    in[I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  A SR Policy is a set of
>    candidate path which consist of one or more segment lists.  The
>    headend node instructs the source routing and writes it into package.
>    The packets steered into an SR Policy have an ordered list of
>    segments associated with that SR Policy written into them. [RFC8655]
>    provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking
>    (DetNet), which provides the capability to carry specified unicast or
>    multicast data flows with extremely low data loss rates and bounded
>    end-to-end latency within a network domain. /
>    /

> New text:/
>    Segment Routing (SR) Policy is defined in [RFC9256]. A SR Policy is a set of
>    candidate path which consist of one or more segment lists.  The
>    headend node instructs the source routing and writes it into SR Header. 
>    The packets steered into an SR Policy have an ordered list of
>    segments associated with that SR Policy written into them./
>     
>     
>    An explicit SR Candidate Path is described in [RFC9256] in section 5.1.  
>    BGP passes the explicit segment paths for unicast Segment Routing (SR) paths 
>    via the SR-Policy NLRIs accompanied with the Tunnel Encapsulation 
>    (Tunnel-Encaps) attribute with the SR Policy Tunnel type TLV
>    for unicast traffic as defined in [draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] 
>    and augmented by [draft-ietf-idr-sr-segtypes-ext].  BGP pases the 
>    explicit segment paths for multicast SR paths via the 
>    SR P2MP Policy NLRI accompanied by the Tunnel-Encaps attribute 
>    for the SR P2MP Policy tunnel type as defined by
>    [draft-ietf-idr-sr-p2mp-policy].    
>    
>    
>   [RFC8655] provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking
>    (DetNet), which provides the capability to carry specified unicast or
>    multicast data flows with extremely low data loss rates and bounded
>    end-to-end latency within a network domain. (continue on with paragraph)/
{.is-info}

   
   
 Old text at end of section:/
    This document defines the SR policy enhancement to carry the Bounded
   Latency Information with a candidate path of SR policy.  So that BLI
   behavior can be enabled automatically when the SR Policy is applied./
   
>  new text:/
>     This document defines a new sub-TLV for Segment List Sub-TLV 
>     that defines the Unicast Explicit SR Path for an SR candidates policy./
{.is-info}


Note: If you intend to add this to multicast, then add the following text:

> New-text-adition: 
>     This document defines a new Sub-TLV for the Segment List Sub-TLV that
> 	defines bounded latency information (BLI) that can be part of a 
>     Segment List Sub-TLV for a Unicast Explicit SR Candidate Policy. 
>     This new Sub-TLV for BLI can also be a part of the segment-list of 
> 	the SR P2MP Tunnel TLV. /
{.is-info}

	
#### Issue 4 - Section 4, fix references to Unicast SR Policy

[draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy] has been replaced by 
[draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] and [draft-ietf-idr-sr-segtypes-ext].

#### Issue-5 - Add a Section for P2MP - if you wish to add BLI to P2MP (multicast)


#### Issue-6: Add an operations or manageability section 

#### Issue-7: Add a Security section 
See [draft-ietf-sr-policy-safi] for ideas. 
You do not need to add text that is in [draft-ietf-sr-policy-safi], but
you need to add security comments about BLI as new critical information.
