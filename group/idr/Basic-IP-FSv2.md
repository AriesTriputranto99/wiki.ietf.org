# Design Team for Basic IP FSv2 for DDOS

## Design Team 1: Basic FS v2 for DDOS 

The key addition for this chunk of FSv2 is the user ordering of filters defined by the FSv2. 

The initial draft((s) will stay with the FSv IPv4 and IPv6 and current actions in the Flow Specification Extended Community (FS-EC).  The focus of this design team is to determine if the technology for user ordering of filters forms a good foundation for FSV2 work. 

**Design team:** Design Team 1 
**initial draft:**  draft-hares-idr-fsv2-ddos  
**New drafts requested:** 
a. Drafts that discuss the pros/cons of filter ordering for work 
b. Drafts with filters 

**Open Design Team Meetings before IETF-120:** 4/29 and 6/3 
**Time for Meeting:** 4/29, 6/3 
**Team Members:** (TBD) 

### Open issues for Design Team 1 
**1. Does the User Ordering Encoding support use cases for current DDOS scenarios? **
There are two 

2. What happens if multiple FSv2 filters are received with the the same user order?
Currently the FSv2 uses the form 


2. More IP Filters for FSv2  
FSv2 opens the possibility to add new filters for data packets (IP and non-IP). This chunk of work expands the IP filters based on the following: 
a. New IP filters from draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-v2 
b. New IP filters proposed to IDR 

Initial draft: draft-hares-idr-fsv2-IP-filters
existing IDR drafts on IP filters: 

3. More IP Actions for FSv2 
FSv2 

4. Non-IP Filters and actions 

As presented at IETF-119 in the IDR session, we will be creating design teams to break the full draft into pieces.
