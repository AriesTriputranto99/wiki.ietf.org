# Welcome to the RTGWG Wiki 
The charter of the Routing Area working group (RTGWG) can be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtgwg/charter/. This charter gives the RTGWG two main functions.

RTGWG is chartered to discuss and evaluate proposals for New Work within the Routing Area, with the goal of finding a home for that work in an existing or new WG in the Routing Area, or rejecting or deferring the New Work. The process for handling New Work Proposals is described in [RTGWG Process for Handling New Work](/group/rtgwg/NewWorkProposals).

RTGWG is also chartered to work on specific small topics that don't fit within an existing working group, as well as larger topics which are explicitly included in the charter. The process for work on topics within the RTGWG charter is described in [Working on Topics in the RTGWG Charter](/group/rtgwg/InCharterWork).
