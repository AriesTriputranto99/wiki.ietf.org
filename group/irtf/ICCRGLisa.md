# LISA resouces 
- [The draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-barik-mptcp-lisa)
- [A page with material by the authors](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/runabk/lisa/)
# Status
This was presented to MPTCP twice, but doesn't fit MPTCP's charter, so ICCRG is now reviewing this (and could be the "home" for it unless the MPTCP charter gets updated to include such congestion control proposals).
