# NetInf
## An architecture and protocol for Information Centric Networking
- Uses a convergence layer architecture similar to DTN ([DTN Archhitecture - RFC 4838](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4838))
- Works on complete information objects with names
	- Known as Named Data Objects (NDOs)
	- Expects that name and corresponding NDO content will be securely coupled
	- Designed particularly with ni URI scheme in mind but other schemes could be used
- Uses simple message/response protocol
- Provides operations for
	- Publishing content objects (PUBLISH, PUBLISH_RESPONSE)
	- Retrieving content objects (GET/GET_RESPONSE)
	- Searching for content objects (SEARCH/SEARCH_RESPONSE)
- Various convergence layers defined (notably HTTP, DTN BP, UDP)
- Source code for reference implementation available at Sourceforge
