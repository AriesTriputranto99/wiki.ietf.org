# Internet Capacity Sharing Architecture 
## A Design Team of the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG)
### Goal
This Design Team was set up at the [ICCRG meeting](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/08nov/iccrg.html) in Nov 2008 after consultation with working groups in the IETF Transport Area.

Its given goal is to produce an informational IRTF RFC proposing a target capacity sharing architecture for the Internet. The process of writing it will foster discussion in the community and record the consensus reached. It could then be used as input to subsequent Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) activity.

The new principle to build on is that the capacity sharing function belongs primarily to the network.

### Discussion
Discussion on this topic is encouraged on the [main ICCRG mailing list](http://oakham.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/iccrg).

### History
Since at least the mid-1970s, one recurrent goal of capacity allocation in packet networks has been for competing flows to use equal bottleneck capacity [Raubold76].

In contrast, in 1985, Fair Queing (FQ [RFC970](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc970.txt)) provided a mechanism for network operators to divide access capacity equally between active source hosts. However, Nagle was careful to point out that this only solved the problem of fairness at one switch, not network-wide, and then only if hosts could be trusted not to spoof multiple source addresses.

In 1987 Van Jacobson's TCP algorithms provided a distributed solution to the network-wide problem of congestion avoidance and control. The congestion avoidance phase aimed for a capacity allocation that is now termed 'window fairness', where competing flows through a bottleneck have equal windows of packets in flight. Thus the unit of capacity allocation became the flow and flows with smaller RTT or with larger packets were expected to take a proportionately greater share of bottleneck link capacity.

The success and prevalence of TCP gradually led to 'window fairness' becoming the 'gold standard' for capacity sharing, both in the IETF and in the data networking research community. In Jan 1997 the term TCP-friendliness was coined for this idea [Madhavi97]. Subsequently, a number of informational and best current practice RFCs put forward TCP-friendliness as a desirable goal of good congestion controls (e.g. [RFC2309](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2309.txt), [RFC2357](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2357.txt), [RFC2914](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2914.txt) [RFC5033](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5033.txt) and [RFC5405](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5405.txt)). But the IETF has always been careful not to state TCP-friendliness as an absolute requirement.

Later in 1997, Kelly [Kelly97] proved that weighted congestion controls would be necessary to optimise the value everyone derives from the Internet. And in 2006, Briscoe spelled out for the IETF why Kelly's work implied equal rates were likely to be extremely unfair [Briscoe07]. It was pointed out that TCP-friendliness doesn't take account of how long flows run for (or how many flows per user). Therefore it leads to such undesirable allocations of capacity that ISPs are increasingly overriding TCP to reach an allocation that their customers, on the whole, prefer.

By Nov 2008 RFC5405 was published still recommending TCP-Friendliness for UDP application designers. But at the same time, with broad support across the IETF transport area, the ICCRG was asked to create a design team to work on a way forward for capacity sharing and congestion control. TCP-Friendliness was seen as a useful stop-gap, but no longer useful as a future direction. Indeed, in a non-binding straw poll during the IETF's Transport Area plenary in March 2009, no-one at all supported TCP-Friendliness as a way forward for the IETF.

In May 2009, the ICCRG further proposed to recognise a distinction between present guidelines and possible future guidelines by forming two complementary strands of work on congestion controls:

1. to continue the ICCRG's role in providing expert [evaluation of proposed](http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/ICCRG#EvaluationofProposedExperimentalCongestionControlSchemes) experimental congestion controls using existing IETF guidelines;
2. in parallel to research new congestion controls that do not aim to share bottleneck capacity equally with TCP, instead presuming some other mechanism controls 'fair' shares.

In Jun 2010, the IETF created the congestion exposure (ConEx) working group to define an experimental change to IP that will give network traffic management nodes sufficient information to share capacity between traffic from different user sites without depending on flow or host identifiers. Outputs from this w-g are progressing [here](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/conex/).
