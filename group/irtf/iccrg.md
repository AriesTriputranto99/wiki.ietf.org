### RG Documents
Welzl, W. Eddy, "Congestion Control in the RFC Series", RFC5783, February 2010.
Papadimitriou, M. Welzl, M. Scharf, B. Briscoe, "Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control", RFC6077, February 2011.

**Current proposals**
- [LISA: A Linked Slow-Start Algorithm for MPTCP](/group/irtf/ICCRGLisa)
- [MulTFRC](/group/irtf/MulTFRC)

- [HTCP](/group/irtf/HTCP)

**Proposals for which ICCRG evaluation has finished - so they were handed over to the IETF for further processing**

- [TCP Alternative Backoff with ECN (ABE)](/group/irtf/TCPAlternativeBackoff)

- [new-cwv](/group/irtf/new-cwv)

- [Compound TCP](/group/irtf/CompoundTPC)

- [CUBIC](/group/irtf/CUBIC)

**TCP Evaluation Suite**

Development of the Common TCP Evaluation Suite started in the [Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG)](/group/tmrg), now closed.

The current version of the draft and companion implementation for the ns2 simulator are available [here](/group/irtf/ICC_TCPeval).

## Evaluation of Proposed Experimental Congestion Control Schemes
How the ICCRG intends to assist the IETF is explained in a [draft ION](http://www.ietf.org/IESG/content/ions/drafts/ion-tsv-alt-cc.txt).

The procedure is:

(1) The authors submit an independent I-D.

(2) The authors explicitly tell the TCPM WG and the TCPM co-chairs [*]

that they'd like their I-D to become a work item and eventually an experimental RFC.

[*] Could perhaps be TSVWG if this is not a TCP scheme (e.g., XCP).

(3) The TCPM co-chairs send an email to the ICCRG co-chairs requesting

that the ICCRG perform a safety review of the document.

(4) The ICCRG chairs mobilize the RG in whatever way they deem useful,

get the reviews and return them to TCPM at the end of some review period.

## Design Teams
We had a design team in ICCRG:

- [Internet Capacity Sharing Architecture](/group/irtf/CapacitySharingArch) led by Matt Mathis & Bob Briscoe. Discussion on this topic is encouraged on the [main ICCRG mailing list](http://oakham.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/iccrg).
## Some Relevant Documents from Related Groups
- [Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms (RFC 5033)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5033.txt)
- [Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion Control Mechanisms (RFC 5166)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5166.txt)
- [UDP Usage Guidelines](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8085.txt)

Please send other documents that need to be included to the RG chairs!
