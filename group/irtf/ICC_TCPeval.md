# Common TCP Evaluation Suite 
## Internet Draft
The latest version of the draft is [here](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-iccrg-tcpeval).

## Test suite implementation
An implementation for the ns2 simulator is [here](https://bitbucket.org/hayesd/tcp-evaluation-suite-public).

## Traces
The suite uses a set of Tmix connection vector traffic traces. They are based on campus traffic at the University of North Carolina. Details about how they were generated can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20100711061914/http://wil-ns.cs.caltech.edu/~benchmark/traffic/).

The traces are available [here](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/michawe/research/tools/combined_traces.tbz) for download.
