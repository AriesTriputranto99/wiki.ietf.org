## Status
After a presentation to TCPM at the Prague IETF (#93) ([slides](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/slides/slides-93-tcpm-9.pdf) and [minutes](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/minutes/minutes-93-tcpm)), ICCRG was asked to review this. This was handed over to TCPM where it is now a WG item.
