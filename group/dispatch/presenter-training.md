Please make your slides! Ideally, you should submit these the Thursday before the session to give the chairs chance to review and approve them. 

To upload your slides, please log in to the datatracker and navigate to this page: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/xxx/session/dispatch

Click 'Propose Slides' and follow the upload instructions. This will automatically notify the Chairs and, once the Chairs approve them, the slides will appear automatically on the datatracker page so can see they are ready.

If you've not presented to dispatch before, or you haven't been to many of our sessions, you might like to look at the previous session materials, videos and slides to get an idea of the format:

* Materials and video for 115: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/115/session/dispatch and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJsPzZITr_g

* Materials and video for 114: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/114/session/dispatch and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyykUxLQhrc

The goal of the dispatch session is to see whether the IETF community is interested in your work. That interest will depend on the problem space you are describing, not on the solution you are proposing. Therefore, we recommend spending the majority of your time on describing the use cases and motivation. It's worth briefly describing the overall shape of your proposed solution, but dispatch isn't the right place to go into detail on packet formats.

It would be good to give your view (if you have one) on where the work should progress within IETF - an existing WG, form a new WG, AD-sponsored, ISE, other. Let the Chairs know if you'd like guidance on this. The most important thing is to leave enough time for the group to discuss, ask you questions, and give their view on the dispatch question too (usually half of your speaking slot).
