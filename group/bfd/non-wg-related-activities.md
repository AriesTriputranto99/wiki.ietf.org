# Adopted Non-WG BFD Documents of Interest
* draft-ietf-idr-bgp-bfd-strict-mode - BGP BFD Strict-Mode.
* draft-ietf-bier-bfd - BIER BFD (ready for WGLC April 2023?)
* draft-ietf-bess-evpn-bfd - EVPN Network Layer Fault Management
* draft-ietf-mpls-bfd-directed (was draft-mirsky-mpls-bfd-directed)
  * 2015-08-31: Adopted in MPLS as a WG document.
  * 2014-11-26: Presented at IETF-91 with updates. Goal is to have adoption in MPLS. BFD will provide review.
  * 2014-07-21: Presented at IETF-90. Also presented in MPLS and SPRING. Received mic comments. Requires further discussion. Authors are encouraged to discuss with authors of draft-vgovindan-mpls-extended-bfd-disc-tlv to create a single BFD TLV model.
* draft-ietf-rtgwg-vrrp-bfd-p2p (was draft-nitish-vrrp-bfd-p2p) - Fast failure detection in VRRP with Point to Point BFD.
  * Re-split of BFD for VRRP proposal for p2p case after RTGWG didn't adopt merged document with IPR issues on the P2MP mechanism. â€‹Discussion
  * Previously: draft-nitish-vrrp-bfd and draft-mirsky-bfd-p2mp-vrrp-use-case
    * 2015-11 Authors have merged their proposals in draft-nitish-vrrp-bfd. Targeted for RTGWG
* draft-ietf-rtgwg-vrrp-p2mp-bfd
  * Replaces draft-mirsky-bfd-p2mp-vrrp-use-case

# BFD Segment Routing Documents of Interest
* draft-ietf-spring-bfd - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in Segment Routing Networks Using MPLS Dataplane (Ready for WGLC 01/2024?).
* draft-ali-spring-bfd-sr-policy - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Segment Routing Policies for Traffic Engineering
* draft-liu-bfd-srv6-policy-encap - Encapsulation of BFD for SRv6 Policy
* draft-lin-sbfd-path-consistency-over-srv6 - S-BFD Path Consistency over SRv6
* draft-chen-spring-sr-policy-for-ubfd - Segment Routing for Unaffiliated BFD Echo Function

# Non-Adopted BFD Documents of Interest
* draft-xiao-bfd-padding-alteration - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Padding Alteration
* draft-mirsky-mpls-bfd-bootstrap-clarify - Clarifying Use of LSP Ping to Bootstrap BFD over MPLS LSP (Note that chairs consider this mostly a call for an RFC 5884-bis)
