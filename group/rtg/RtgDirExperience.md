# Routing Directorate Members Experience and Interests 

This page gives a **very brief** summary of the experience and interests of the members of the Routing Area Directorate. It is intended to give the ADs and Administrators some clues when they are looking for specific skills or clue.

When you joins the Routing Directorate, you should update this wiki page.  Please update your entry and keep updating it as your interests change. But *please* don't add too much detail.
