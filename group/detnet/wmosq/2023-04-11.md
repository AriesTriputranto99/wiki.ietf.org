IETF Deterministic Networking (detnet) - Open Working Meeting

**Time:** April 11, 2023 - 8p-10p (US Eastern Time Zone)
**Zoom info:** https://Dell.zoom.us/j/91506535175?pwd=MTJZUzFBTUJLcmVLTzNhT05zQUJsZz09
**DO NOT USE IETF WebEx for this meeting!!**
**Organizer:** DetNet WG [detnet-chairs@ietf.org](mailto:detnet-chairs@ietf.org), [David Black](mailto:David.Black@dell.com) (tech advisor)

*Reminder - this is an open working meeting to facilitate progress on the enhanced DetNet data plane. The initial focus is on queueing/scheduling mechanisms in DetNet nodes.  No final decisions will be made in this meeting - the working group mailing list is the decision forum/venue.*

# Agenda
1. Quick intro (including Note Well slide), agenda bashing

1. Process-oriented topics - requirements, draft contents, evaluation, etc.
Time: 30 minutes, could be longer
Discussion could include:
   - Separating queueing/scheduling mechanisms from on-the-wire information encoding.
   - Use of requirements draft to evaluate proposed solutions (e.g., stability, test run with TSN queueing/scheduling mechanisms?)
   - Evaluation criteria beyond scope of requirements draft

1. In-depth presentations of two queueing/scheduling mechanisms
Time: 40-45 minutes each.
Could postpone one of these presentations if item (1) discussion takes longer.

Presentations expected to be ready for these two drafts (~30 mins of presentation + Q&A):
   - [draft-joung-detnet-asynch-detnet-framework-02](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-joung-detnet-asynch-detnet-framework/02/) Asynchronous Deterministic Networking Framework for Large-Scale Networks
   - [draft-peng-detnet-deadline-based-forwarding-05](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-peng-detnet-deadline-based-forwarding/05/) Deadline Based Deterministic Forwarding

There will be opportunities in future open working meetings for additional in-depth presentations.
