IETF Deterministic Networking (detnet) - Open Working Meeting

**Time:** April 11, 2023 - 8p-10p (US Eastern Time Zone)
**Zoom info:** https://Dell.zoom.us/j/91506535175?pwd=MTJZUzFBTUJLcmVLTzNhT05zQUJsZz09
**DO NOT USE IETF WebEx for this meeting!!**
**Organizer:** DetNet WG [detnet-chairs@ietf.org](mailto:detnet-chairs@ietf.org), [David Black](mailto:David.Black@dell.com) (tech advisor)

*Reminder - this is an open working meeting to facilitate progress on the enhanced DetNet data plane. The initial focus is on queueing/scheduling mechanisms in DetNet nodes.  No final decisions will be made in this meeting - the working group mailing list is the decision forum/venue.*

# Agenda
1. Quick intro (including Note Well slide), agenda bashing

1. Process-oriented topics - requirements, draft contents, evaluation, etc.
Time: 30 minutes, could be longer
Discussion could include:
   - Separating queueing/scheduling mechanisms from on-the-wire information encoding.
   - Use of requirements draft to evaluate proposed solutions (e.g., stability, test run with TSN queueing/scheduling mechanisms?)
   - Evaluation criteria beyond scope of requirements draft

1. In-depth presentations of two queueing/scheduling mechanisms
Time: 40-45 minutes each.
Could postpone one of these presentations if item (1) discussion takes longer.

Presentations expected to be ready for these two drafts (~30 mins of presentation + Q&A):
   - [draft-joung-detnet-asynch-detnet-framework-02](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-joung-detnet-asynch-detnet-framework/02/) Asynchronous Deterministic Networking Framework for Large-Scale Networks
   - [draft-peng-detnet-deadline-based-forwarding-05](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-peng-detnet-deadline-based-forwarding/05/) Deadline Based Deterministic Forwarding

There will be opportunities in future open working meetings for additional in-depth presentations.

Agenda bashing: None

1. Process-oriented topics - requirements, draft contents, evaluation, etc

Discussion about evaluation criteria and impact (or not) of discussing evaluation critera onto existing requirements draft.

David: Maybe each draft wants to come up with their own top 5 (where solution thinks it performs well/best).
TBD (Toerless): revise evaluation criteria draft, moving out TCQF evaluation into TCQF draft to start making evaluation criteria become more neutral - but very important for every proposal to think of their own critera as well!

Yizhou: can/do we have normative language for queuing mechanism ? IEEE does it, i do not see having it currently in IETF draft.
David: Should be fine to point to an IEEE documented 

David: focus on scheduling mechanism, assuming that there is going to be a mechanism how the requireed signaling elements will be encoded. But separation is primarily meant to be to make 

David: we hae way more encoding proposal options than actual scheduling/enqueuing mechanisms. So in my opinion more important now to focus/refine/compare those mechanisms from their encoding options. Whether/how to finally standardise the overall solution with scheduling and encoding (single / multiple documents) is still open.

 DiffServ: RFC2474 (data plane encoding), RFC2475 (Architecture)
 
 Yizhou: forwarding plane dependencies to the routing mechanism, e.g.: SRv6/SRH.
 
David: Document applicability to different data-planes, such as SR(-MPLS/v6).
Toerless: All mechanisms proposed should be able to be made work with all steering mechanisms the IETF has specified (e.g.: SR-MPLS, SRv6/SHR, BIER, "MSR6"), but those mechanisms raise the questions how to combine headers for DetNet dta-plane with this steering data-plane. David: lets get to that point after understanding the scheduling mechansisms.

David: Test run IEEE mechanisms against our requirements draft / evaluation criteria to show how they do not solve our large scale detnet requirements.

Peng Liu: Other proposal have no IEEE reference. David: This is fine (not to have a reference).

David: Would like to make sure requirements draft is stable so proposals can be checked against it. Would be great to have it stable by start of may.

 - [draft-joung-detnet-asynch-detnet-framework-02](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-joung-detnet-asynch-detnet-framework/02/) Asynchronous Deterministic Networking Framework for Large-Scale Networks
 Jinoo Joung.
 
 FAIR and PFAR are extensions of ATS that allow it to scale somewhat better, but all with pro/cons. Focus of draft is C-SCORE. 
 
 Toerless ? Actual proposal is primarily for C-SCORE (for large scale DetNets): Answer: mostly yes.
