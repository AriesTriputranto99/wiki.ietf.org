There's a related [Github repository](https://github.com/becarpenter/animaproto) for the protocol draft.

There is an open source prototype implementation in Python 3 (corresponding to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-anima-grasp) at https://github.com/becarpenter/graspy. Start by looking at the PDF files, especially graspy.pdf.

There is an obsolete prototype implementation in C (corresponding to  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol-03, not the latest version) at  https://github.com/liubingpang/IETF-Anima-Signaling-Protocol.git. Note that it comes with an evaluation-only license, it is not fully open-source code.
