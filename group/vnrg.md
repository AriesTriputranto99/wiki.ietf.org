### IAB Review July 2010 (Maastricht) 

Each RG is reviewed by the IAB:
  * for the IAB to improve its understanding of what the research groups are up to, where there's coverage and where there isn't;
  * for the RG to improve its understanding of architectural issues, broader context for the research, and possible tie-ins with IETF working group activity;
  * to give the IRTF chair a tool for helping to manage the RGs, and managerial input from the IAB;
