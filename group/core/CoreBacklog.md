This page maintains a backlog of work that the WG has identified as highest priority to work on next.

NOTE: to review by CoRE WG - it seems we today use datatracker to keep track of work items?


| Work Item               | Priority | IESG Submission | Status      | Related Work                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ALPN                    | Normal   | TBD/2025        | WG Document | [draft-ietf-core-dtls-alpn](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-coap-dtls-alpn/)                                                                                            |
| DNS-over-CoAP           | Normal   | TBD/2025        | WG Document | [draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap/)                                                                                              |
| Other topics here?      | High     | Q4/2025         | New draft   | |                                                
                                                
The following priority levels are used:

- High: This work item is high priority, and should be the next to try and progress through the WG
- Normal: This work item is normal priority
- Low: This work item is low priority, and would be nice to have, but should wait until higher priority work is complete
