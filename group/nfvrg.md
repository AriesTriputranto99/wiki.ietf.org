# Network Function Virtualization Research Group (NFVRG) (Concluded)
## Charter page 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-irtf-nfvrg/

## Chairs 
Ram (Ramki) Krishnan (VMware - ramkik@vmware.com), Diego Lopez (Telefonica - diego.r.lopez@telefonica.com)

## Mailing List
nfvrg@irtf.org

Subscription: https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/nfvrg

## Current Drafts 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/nfvrg/documents/

## Research Agenda 

NFVRG has identified a list of concrete matters as the main focus of its activity, that define the ''research agenda'' of the group. These matters are:

* Re-architecting of network functions

* New management and orchestration frameworks

* Techniques to guarantee dataplane features (latency, loss…) and topology properties

* Measurement and benchmarking

This research agenda is expected to translate into different forms of results relevant to the evolution of the NFV technologies and its application to Internet architecture, including documents describing these results, contributions to IETF WGs and other open standardisation initiatives (open-source projects, other SDOs...).
