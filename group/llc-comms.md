# About
The IETF LLC comms group aims to provide greater transparency for, get input on, and answer any questions about IETF LLC marketing communications work in support of the ongoing operations of the IETF, including meetings and non-meeting activities and raising money on behalf of the IETF. Discussion is intended to cover items at a tactical-level, and to be complementary (rather than duplicative) of work surfaced and discussed as part of the Education and Outreach Directorate (eodir). Meetings are open to any interested IETF participant.
