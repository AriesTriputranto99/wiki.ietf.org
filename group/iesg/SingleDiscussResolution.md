 In late 2008, the IESG adopted a new internal procedure to resolve a single DISCUSS position blocking document advancement.

If a document is brought to a second telechat, there is only one DISCUSS vote, no other ADs have expressed support for that DISCUSS vote, and the document otherwise has sufficient YES or NO OBJECTION votes to pass (2/3 of IESG + 1 yes for standards track, 1 yes vote for info/experimental), then the document is approved.

When an AD agrees with another AD's discuss, it is typical for that AD to vote NO OBJECTION but to state "I support DISCUSS by [name-of-discussing-ad]" at the top of their ballot comment.
