# Datatracker Review Tool How-To 

The Datatracker Review Tool is a feature that implements the requirements covered in RFC 7735 - Tracking Reviews of Documents. 

See the [current list of bugs and enhancements for the Datatracker Review Tool](https://github.com/ietf-tools/datatracker).

This how-to is somewhat Gen-ART-centric, but I hope that it is useful for reviewers in other directorates. 

The information on this page is also geared for reviewers. Information for secretaries can be found on the [[DatatrackerReviewToolHowtoSecretary|How-to for Secretaries]] page.


## Accessing the Review Tool

Prerequisites
* A Datatracker username and password. If you do not have these, 
  go to https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/create/
  to create or reset your login. Once you have created an account, let the secretary know so that you can be given access to the review tool.

To access the tool:

1. Go to https://datatracker.ietf.org/.
2. Select '''Sign in''' from the '''User''' menu. Provide your username and password. Upon successful login, the front page of the Datatracker reappears and your username is displayed as a label for the user menu. If your login was unsuccessful, please visit [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/create/|the Datatracker account page]].
3. To ensure that your user information is correct, select '''Account Info''' from your user menu to check your user information.

To see an overview of your review team's assignments:

1. Go to https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/genart/reviews/. You do not have to be logged in. This information is generally available. 
2. You can also select '''genart reviews''' from the '''Documents''' menu. 

## Setting Review Preferences 

The review tool allows you to specify how often you want assignments, and when you want to be reminded of deadlines. It also allows you to set times of unavailability. 

1. Log into [Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/). 
2. Select '''My Reviews''' from your user menu. The '''Review Overview''' page appears. 
3. If you have been participating on a review team for any period of time, you may need to scroll down to the bottom of the page to find your settings. You will have separate sections for each review team in which you are a participant.  
4. Click the '''Change Settings''' button. The '''Change reviewer settings''' page appears. 
5. Click the '''Save''' button when you are done with the settings. 

The following preferences can be set:
 Review wishes::
  In this field, you can select a draft that you would like to be assigned to you when it becomes available for review. 
 Can review at most::
  Allows you to set how often you want to receive assignments. 
 Filter regexp::
  Allows you specify patterns of draftnames, using regular expressions, that you don't not want to receive as assignments (for instance, your own drafts, or drafts from working groups where you participate heavily). 
 Remind days before deadline::
  If set, you will receive an email reminder for any incomplete reviews. Note that the deadline for any Telechat reviews is 2 days before the Telechat. 
 Unavailable periods::
  Block off any time where you would be unavailable. You can specify a 'soft' break where you would not be assigned any new reviews but could still follow up on existing assignments. 



## Accepting or Rejecting Assignments

You will receive an email when you are given an assignment:

1. Log into [Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/). 
2. Either select '''My Reviews''' from your user menu or go here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/review/. The '''Review Overview''' page appears. 
3. In the Assigned Reviews list, click the draftname link. A '''Review Request''' page appears.
4. Click the '''Accept''' button to accept the assignment. 
5. Click the '''Reject''' button to reject the assignment - the secretary will be notified that another reviewer needs to be selected.


## Finishing Assignments

You have three options for submitting your review: 
* Entering the review directly into the Datatracker, which will automatically post to gen-art@ietf.org.
