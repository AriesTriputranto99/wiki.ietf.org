 MIB documents in general need (or so an earlier IESG agreed to) expert review from a MIB Doctor. At the time of writing the OPS AD responsible for the NM side of the house has been functioning as a central contact point for ADs (but also for WG chairs) to request MIB Doctor review for IETF (and other) MIB documents.

At the time of writing the common understanding/agreement in the IESG is that every MIB document gets a MIB Doctor review BEFORE the responsible AD issues an IETF Last Call. If such is not done, then the OPS AD responsoble for NM normally ensures that such a MIB doctor review gets done before he takes a YES or NoObjection? position on the document.

Details about the MIB Doctors can be found at http://www.ietf.org/iesg/directorate/mib-doctors.html.
