# Issue Tracking
The Secretariat handles many small items of work, and thus needs systematic issue tracking. Emails that don't go into the issue tracker **will** get lost.

Therefore, when raising any kind of operational issue with the Secretariat, it's essential to use the email addresses that feed the tracker. We now use a single-entry address for all issues: [support@ietf.org](mailto:support@ietf.org).

When you write to this address, you should soon receive a robotic reply including a ticket number in the subject field. For example, *[Inquiry # 84280] Auto Reply: Fix to the home page.* Make sure to conserve this subject field in all replies, so that the tracker can track the thread.

Tip: when sending a ticket to the Secretariat that you want the whole IESG to see, but you do not want the whole IESG involved in the robotic follow-up, do it like this:

>  Subject: Approved: draft-foo-bar-73
>  To: iesg@ietf.org
>  Bcc: support@ietf.org
> 

Then only you will be involved in the follow-up.

## Suggested Subject Lines for Tickets 

These days, most tickets get automatically generated by the Datatracker when you request Last Calls, request publication, make an RFC Editor Note, place documents on telechat agendas, etc. If you complete these tasks via the Datatracker there is no need to send a separate ticket. However, if you need to provide additional clarification, something seems to have gone wrong, or you want the Secretariat to manually review something, please use the following guidelines. 

1. Request to Publish: [insert file name of I-D]

 Please use this subject line when requesting that an I-D be published as an RFC. (Note: These requests usually come from a WG chair or an individual author.)

2. Last Call: [insert file name of I-D]

  Please use this subject line when requesting a Last Call, or when clarifying a Last Call request made via the Datatracker. If multiple documents are included in the Last Call, then please use the filename of one of them, and explain in the body of the message that you are requesting a single Last Call for multiple documents.

3. Agenda: [insert file name of I-D]

  Please use this subject line when requesting that a document be placed on the agenda for the next telechat.

4. RFC Editor Note: [insert file name of I-D]

  Please use this subject line when forwarding an RFC Editor Note to be included in the approval announcement for a document.

5.  IESG Note: [insert file name of I-D]

  Please use this subject line when forwarding an IESG Note to be included in the approval announcement for a document.

6. Approved: [insert file name of I-D]

  Please use this subject line when notifying the Secretariat that a document has been approved for publication between telechats. If multiple documents are included in the approval, then please use the filename that you used when you issued the Last Call.

7.  Query: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line when requesting information about something that the Secretariat knows something about (like "what happened to my request for X?"). Please use an abbreviated "topic" in the subject line (to avoid truncating the text) and provide details in the body of the message.

8. Management Issue: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line when requesting that a management issue be added to the IESG Teleconference Agenda.

9. Agenda Bash: [insert topic]

  Please use this subject line when requesting an IESG Teleconference agenda bash (i.e., to request a late management issue, to change the order of documents, to remove an item from the agenda after the final agenda and package have been sent, etc.).
