Both Stds track and Info docs require IETF consensus, but have differnet IESG ballot requirements.  My question is whether we should consider relaxing the ballot rules for Stds Track docs to match the rules for Informational, or the reverse?

First, Discuss audio problems with remote-attendence to side-meetings, should/can we do more here (some sort of Meetecho support)? 
Also do we need approval for side meetings?

See https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/support-documents/

* Declaration of paricipant affiliation (e.g., for consultants) (Rob) (30 mins)
Soemtimes I see participants change their position to strongly align with those of a particular company, and yet they just indicating their affiliation as a consultant.  Does this end up skewing/manipulating the standards process?  If someone is be paid by a company to help push a draft or technology then should that be declared, even if they are a consultant?
