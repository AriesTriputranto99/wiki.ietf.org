### Dates 

* 2023-05-08 to 2023-05-10

### Remote Participation 

TBD:

### Location 

Seattle, WA, USA

### Covid Information 

### Candidate Meeting Topics
Suggested topics for the next face-to-face meeting here.

The IESG chair and IAB chair will review this list and assign the topics to a slot below (or remember them for future discussion, e.g. at the retreat).

1. IESG+IAB: NomCom process for Joint Discussion (Mirja)
Review the nomcom process and identify things to improve (briefly discussed by the IAB in exceuative session on Feb 22, and the week before by IESG)

1. IESG+IAB: Ballot process and IETF consensus for Joint Discussion (Mirja)
Based on recent discussion there are two subtopics: a) the question about what's approriate to put in a ballot disussion, and b) a technical discussion on the topic that triggered this discussion

1. IESG+IAB: Discussion about publically announce author/design-team meetings vs interims  (Wes)

1. IAB+IESG: review of IAB-ISOC group (Owner?)

1. IESG+IAB: Discussion on the outreach activities (Dhruv) 
Discussion on various outreach activities and how the coordination function can be improved

1. IESG: Is an update to IESG statement on "Support Documents in IETF Working Groups" needed? (added by Mirja but will not drive it) 
See https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/support-documents/

1. IESG: IPR disclosures: do we have countermeasures against spurious/late disclosures? (Owner?)

1. IESG: Change voting requirements for Stds Track documents (Rob)
Both Stds track and Info docs require IETF consensus, but have differnet IESG ballot requirements.  My question is whether we should consider relaxing the ballot rules for Stds Track docs to match the rules for Informational, or the reverse?

1. IESG: Review year-by-year meeting stats (added by Mirja but Greg needs to provide numbers)

1. IESG: Areamandering: Rearranging the areas (Martin)

1. IESG: Letters of invitation for interim meetings (Martin)

1. IESG: Discuss audio problems with remote-attendence to side-meetings, should/can we do more here (some sort of Meetecho support)? (Added by Rob, but don't need to own)

1. IAB: new programs, e.g. e-impact (e-impact might go to joint day...?)
