### Agenda 

#### Monday, May 8, 2023 IESG Only

**9:00 Start**

* Post-pandemic SWOT/PEST analysis and compare to the last one of 2019 (Éric, 60 min)
Check with Eric about scope and prep -> Lars to send an email to Eric

* Review year-by-year meeting stats (Mirja, 30 min)
-> Mirja to check with Greg (added by Mirja but Greg needs to provide numbers) 

**10:30 - 11:00 Coffe Break**

* Areamandering: Rearranging the areas (Martin, 60 min)
Attempt to balance (and maybe reduce?) the AD workloads across different areas. Opportunity to redraw boundaries around cohesive areas of work, leading to easier AD recruitment.

**12:00 - 13:30 Lunch**

* Change voting requirements for Stds Track documents (Rob, 90 min)
Both Stds track and Info docs require IETF consensus, but have differnet IESG ballot requirements.  My question is whether we should consider relaxing the ballot rules for Stds Track docs to match the rules for Informational, or the reverse?
This may also lead to a reduction in AD workload, and increase the AD candidate pool.

**15:00 - 15:30 Coffee break**

* Area shopping (Andrew, 30 min)
-> Lars to check

* Letters of invitation for interim meetings (Martin, 30 min)

* The future of Technology Deep Dives (Warren, 20 min)
Warren is currently driving the TDD series, but it doesn't have an official sponsor. Should this be an IESG program?

* Operator Outreach (Warren, 10 min)
Are all y'all willing to provide a 2 - 3 sentence summary of highlights of work in your area?


**17:00 end**


#### Tuesday, May 9, 2023 IESG Only

**9:00 Start**

* Side meeting discussion (Rob, 90 min)
First, Discuss audio problems with remote-attendence to side-meetings, should/can we do more here (some sort of Meetecho support)? 
Also do we need approval for side meetings?
Also, how to prevent WGs from using side meetings for WG business?

**10:30- 11:00 Coffee**

* IPR disclosures: do we have countermeasures against spurious/late disclosures? (Martin, 60 min)
Can Brad join for this? -> Lars will check

**12:00-13:30 Lunch**

* Is an update to IESG statement on "Support Documents in IETF Working Groups" needed? (Lars, 15-30 min) 
See https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/support-documents/

* Declaration of paricipant affiliation (e.g., for consultants) (Rob, 30 min)
Soemtimes I see participants change their position to strongly align with those of a particular company, and yet they just indicating their affiliation as a consultant.  Does this end up skewing/manipulating the standards process?  If someone is be paid by a company to help push a draft or technology then should that be declared, even if they are a consultant?

**15:00 Departure for University of Washington Visit**
To be confirmed, but the plan is that us (some of IESG and IAB) and the UW folks would each present some lightning talks of "interesting things", and we'd have a bit of discussion on each. Topics from our side:
* Brief IETF intro (Lars)
* Jiankang
* Éric
* Zahed
* Rob
* Paul
* Mirja (recap of the e-impact IAB workshop)
* Dhruv
* Qin
