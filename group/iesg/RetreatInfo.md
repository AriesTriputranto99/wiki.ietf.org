### Candidate Meeting Topics
Suggested topics for the next face-to-face meeting here.

The IESG chair and IAB chair will review this list and assign the topics to a slot below (or remember them for future discussion, e.g. at the retreat).

1. Post-pandemic SWOT/PEST analysis and compare to the last one of 2019 (Ã‰ric V)
Check with Eric about scope and prep

1. IESG+IAB: NomCom process for Joint Discussion (Mirja)
Review the nomcom process and identify things to improve (briefly discussed by the IAB in exceuative session on Feb 22, and the week before by IESG)

1. IESG+IAB: Ballot process and IETF consensus for Joint Discussion (Mirja)
Based on recent discussion there are two subtopics: a) the question about what's approriate to put in a ballot disussion, and b) a technical discussion on the topic that triggered this discussion

1. IESG+IAB: Discussion about publically announce author/design-team meetings vs interims  (Wes)

1. IAB+IESG: review of IAB-ISOC group (Owner?)

1. IESG+IAB: Discussion on the outreach activities (Dhruv) 
Discussion on various outreach activities and how the coordination function can be improved
This may include a discussion about organization of eodir (comment by Mirja)

1. IESG+IAB: What is the next step of YANG Catalog? Service Oriented YANG Pilot Project (Added by Qin)
The YANG Catalog provides a place where vendors and operators can share and find the data models that make configuring and operating networks easier, is that all? What is the next step of YANG catalog? How to make good use of these models for automated service management, what is the Challenging and Issues of Implementing YANG? 

1. IESG: Is an update to IESG statement on "Support Documents in IETF Working Groups" needed? (added by Mirja but will not drive it) 
See https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/support-documents/

1. IESG: IPR disclosures: do we have countermeasures against spurious/late disclosures? (Owner?)

1. IESG: Change voting requirements for Stds Track documents (Rob)
Both Stds track and Info docs require IETF consensus, but have differnet IESG ballot requirements.  My question is whether we should consider relaxing the ballot rules for Stds Track docs to match the rules for Informational, or the reverse?

1. IESG: Review year-by-year meeting stats (added by Mirja but Greg needs to provide numbers)

1. IESG: Areamandering: Rearranging the areas (Martin)

1. IESG: Letters of invitation for interim meetings (Martin)

1. IESG: Discuss audio problems with remote-attendence to side-meetings, should/can we do more here (some sort of Meetecho support)? (Added by Rob, but don't need to own)

1. IAB: new programs, e.g. e-impact (e-impact might go to joint day...?)

1. IESG+IAB: How to deal with side meetings

1. IESG+IAB?: Declaration of paricipant affiliation (e.g., for consultants) (added by Rob)
Soemtimes I see participants change their position to strongly align with those of a particular company, and yet they just indicating their affiliation as a consultant.  Does this end up skewing/manipulating the standards process?  If someone is be paid by a compnany to help push a draft or technology then should that be declared, even if they are a consultant?

1. IESG: Finalize YANG security template text (added by Rob)
We may resolve this earlier over email, and this could possibly just be a side topic for Rob + Sec ADs.  But adding as a potential place holder.

1. IESG+IAB: List of (security) research topics (Chris)

1. IAB: Workshop in ID management (Cullen)

1. IAB: Discussion/review of processes, e.g. wg charter review process, BoF sheperding, workshops orga, programs/groups, liaison positions, etc. (Mirja)
