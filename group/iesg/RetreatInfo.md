Both Stds track and Info docs require IETF consensus, but have differnet IESG ballot requirements.  My question is whether we should consider relaxing the ballot rules for Stds Track docs to match the rules for Informational, or the reverse?

#### Tuesday, May 9, 2023 IESG Only

#### Wednesday, May 10, 2023 IESG and IAB Joint Meeting

1. IESG+IAB: What is the next step of YANG Catalog? Service Oriented YANG Pilot Project (Added by Qin) (30 mins)
The YANG Catalog provides a place where vendors and operators can share and find the data models that make configuring and operating networks easier, is that all? What is the next step of YANG catalog? How to make good use of these models for automated service management, what is the Challenging and Issues of Implementing YANG? 


1. NomCom process for Joint Discussion (Mirja) (15mins)
Review the nomcom process and identify things to improve (briefly discussed by the IAB in exceuative session on Feb 22, and the week before by IESG)

1. e-impact IAB program or BoF; report from side meeting (15 mins)


1. IESG+IAB?: Declaration of paricipant affiliation (e.g., for consultants) (added by Rob) (30 mins)
Soemtimes I see participants change their position to strongly align with those of a particular company, and yet they just indicating their affiliation as a consultant.  Does this end up skewing/manipulating the standards process?  If someone is be paid by a compnany to help push a draft or technology then should that be declared, even if they are a consultant?

1. IESG: Finalize YANG security template text (added by Rob)
We may resolve this earlier over email, and this could possibly just be a side topic for Rob + Sec ADs.  But adding as a potential place holder.
