 The RFC Editor accepts reports of potential errata against documents in the RFC series.

The IESG is tasked with verifying the errata reports, and has prepared a [statement](http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/errata-processing.html) on how they should be processed. Note carefully that these guidelines set a fairly high bar for Approving errata. There have been unintended consequences affecting deployments (and prolonged periods of implementor confusion), particularly when code-point assignments are affected. Please be sure to consider such approvals very carefully.

Many ADs delegate the verification review to appropriate chairs or active community members.

The current set of errata can be viewed/searched at http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.php.

The tools used to enter a verification result are documented at https://www.rfc-editor.org/how_to_verify.html.
