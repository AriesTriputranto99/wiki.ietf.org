 Proposed IESG statement on Perpass and DISCUSSes

When an extension or minor update is made to an existing protocol that has unaddressed issues, it would not be appropriate to hold a DISCUSS on that document demanding that the problem in the base protocol specification be addressed; rather, the way to address problems of this sort is to update the base protocol specification. For example, the IETF identified pervasive monitoring as a risk that working groups consider. This would not justify holding a DISCUSS on the extension or minor update.
