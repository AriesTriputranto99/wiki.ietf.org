# Document Language Editing Session for IETF 89 in London 

## VNFpool problem statement (Zongning) 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zong-vnfpool-problem-statement/

I believe that further improvement on the language of this I-D is very important for the upcoming VNFPool BoF (approved) in London, especially for a wider community to understand the new terms, concepts, and background of the proposed new work in IETF.

## PCE Protocol Extensions for Link Bandwidth Utilization (Qin Wu) 

"Extensions to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for handling Link Bandwidth Utilization"

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wu-pce-pcep-link-bw-utilization/

This document is chosen as an example of one of Qin's documents that is likely to make progress in a working group and has authors of three different nationalities. 

## PPSP Tracker Protocol-Base Protocol (Lingli Deng) 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppsp-base-tracker-protocol/

This draft has been mostly drafted by Chinese co-authors and obviously need improvement on language in order to be further moved forward.
