### Administrivia

**1. Alldispatch: next steps (Francesca)**

Now that we've had 2 Alldispatch meetings, it's time to decide if the experiment was successful (so charter a WG), unsuccessful (go back to separate Dispatch groups), or if we need to run it a bit longer (1, 2 more meetings?). We have a deadline of September 6th if we need to enter it as a BoF request.

### Document Discussions

### Management Issues
- Quick review of [BOF request wiki](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bof-requests)? Seem to be several spam requests - Secretariat want to check which are real before we delete some as spam. 

- New Participant Program (Michelle Cotton)

- IETF 125 Decision (Roman)

### WG News 

### Documents to Swap 

### AOB

### Executive Sessions


### Parking Lot
Please list topics in this section that could use discussion but may not warrant a meeting on their own. 

### Topics Deferred Till Next Informal
