## Regrets

* John can only attend first hour on April 20 (if there's a meeting)
* Ériv V can only attend the first hour as well (and no, it is not to chat with John ;-) )
* Warren too!
* Rob - possible regrets.  At most 1 hour, and school lifts might interrupt that.

### Administrivia

### Document Discussions

### Management Issues

Please use your best judgement to add new items into one of the categories below.

#### Urgent and important
* Finalizing feedback to ICANN board on CEO search (Lars)

* SWOT/PEST analysis during the retreat (Éric V)
As one retreat agenda item is about a SWOT/PEST analysis, let's quickly introduce the concept (based on [previous work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qHsyX8hwx5--ZfkEDk7LDbva60xcuIDLqfBpRpYMFmM/edit?usp=sharing)  by Alvaro Retena, Martin Vigoureux, and Rob Wilton) and ***decide*** whether the focus should be on the IETF as a whole or just about the IESG.

#### Urgent but not important

#### Not important and not urgent
* PrivacyPass deliverable and Charter consideration (added by Paul)
The charter talks about a deliverable "HTTP-layer API for the protocol" but the WG document has evolved to an "HTTP authentication scheme". If any AD feels this is out of charter, please speak up so we can start recharter before doc hits PubReq.
