### WG News

### AOB

### Executive Sessions


### Parking Lot
Please list topics in this section that could use discussion but may not warrant a meeting on their own. 

#### 1. Action item from 121:  IESG to decide whether we are going to collectively agree to opt in 
   to the RPC auth 48 Github experiment if authors are part of the github experiment.
    
#### 2. Reminder: Side Meetings
If IESG wants to make changes to how side meetings work, ideally this could be decided in January so the Secretariat/LLC can have time to implement any changes before 122. (Per the usual schedule, the wiki offering side meeting slots will be published on 21 Feb 2025)

#### 3. Alldispatch - way forward (Francesca)

We need to decide on the Alldispatch experiment. Relevant:
