# Archive of Past IESG Projects 

 * [2nd Retreat](/group/iesg/archive/2ndretreat) - agenda bash for possible 2nd retreat in 2019

 * [Quick Working Groups](/group/iesg/archive/quickworkinggroups) - Quickly chartering short-lived, tightly scoped working groups with short schedules (Barry and Pete)

 * [Mailing List Archiving](/group/iesg/archive/mailinglistarchiving) - Proposed IESG Statement regarding mailing list archiving (Pete)

 * [Draft 2119 Boilerplate Suggestions](/group/iesg/archive/draft2119boilerplatesuggestions) - Proposed boilerplate for use with RFC2119 that allows the use of RFC2119 keywords in normal text if they are not in all-uppercase.


 * [Special Use Top Level Domain Process](/group/iesg/archive/specialusetopleveldomainprocess) - How to deal with requests for special use TLDs

 * [Perpass Discuss Criteria](/group/iesg/archive/perpassdiscusscriteria) - how the IESG approaches draft-farrell-perpass-attack

 * [IESG Reorg Messages](/group/iesg/archive/iesgreorgmessages) - Proposed messages to the community on the IESG Re-organization

 * [Modern Formats Discussion](/group/iesg/archive/modernformatsdiscussion) - in-progress capturing current IESG thoughts on updating RFC canonical format

 * [Liaison Purposes](/group/iesg/archive/liaisonpurposes) - discussing role of IAB and IESG liaisons

 * [Meeting Experiments](/group/iesg/archive/meetingexperiments) - documenting experiments tried for WG meeting


 * [Charter Internal Review Block Criteria](/group/iesg/charterinternalreviewblockcriteria) - Proposed criteria for balloting 'Block' during IESG internal review of a WG charter proposed for external review.

 * [Number Of Authors](/group/iesg/archive/numberofauthors) - IESG Statement on the Number of Authors in an IETF Document (Alvaro and Terry)

## Some abandoned or obsolete stuff that's nonetheless useful to save 

 * [Draft Shepherd Writeup WG Alternate](/group/iesg/draft/draftshepherdwriteupwgalternate) - A new proposal for a radical change to the shepherd writeup, as discussed at IETF 84.  This is a version that strips out all the yes/no sorts of things and instead asks for a paragraph or two of information in each of five categories.  **(This is now part of the normal shepherd writeup documentation)**

 * [Draft Note Well Summary](/group/iesg/draft/draftnotewell) - A draft version of a very short Note Well summary.  **(This is now dead.)**

 * [Draft Boilerplate Change](/group/iesg/draft/draftboilerplatechange) - A draft of a change to the boilerplate for cases where we are publishing something (such as documentation of a vendor-specific mechanism) where the community has consensus to publish, but consensus on the content doesn't make sense.  **(The IAB has chosen not to approve this, but the text is still useful as an IESG note in such documents.)**
