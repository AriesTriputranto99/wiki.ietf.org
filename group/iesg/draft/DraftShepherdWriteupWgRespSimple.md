### 1. Summary

The document shepherd is Herkermer Biffelwogg. The responsible Area Director is Shaquila Yazenzahta.

This document extends the Lightweight Modular Network Operations Protocol (LMNOP) by adding an option to control optimization of frodiddles when the evil bit is set. It is proposing the new option as a standard extension to LMNOP, and the working group is quite sure that this will be a useful Standards Track extension.

### 2. Review and Consensus

The extension is straightforward, and there was no difficulty in coming to consensus on all points. A number of implementations are in the works, but none are finished yet. Because of the simplicity, there was little real discussion of the document. The shepherd solicited three reviews beyond those who commented on the list, and those resulted in only editorial changes. We believe the working group is solidly behind this. Expert review has been requested for the new LMNOP option, and the expert gave a preliminary go-ahead and has promised to finish her review during IETF last call. I found an ABNF error during shepherd review, but everything looks good now.
### 3. Intellectual Property

Each author has confirmed conformance with BCP 78/79. There are no IPR disclosures on the document.
### 4. Other Points

There is a normative downref to RFC 9876, "Security Aspects of Hypothetical Biffles".
