# Draft statement for Git repositories 

This page will keep our latest draft of a statement to be placed on Git repositories that are used for IETF work.  It is base on the DraftNoteWellSummary and on the [https://irtf.org/ipr IRTF IPR statement].

----
## Technical Contributions to the IETF 

This repository is made available for IETF work.  By using this repository for IETF contributions, you agree to these terms.  See the bottom of the page for detailed references.

### Note Well 
This summary does not contain all the details and is only meant to point you in the right direction.  Exceptions may apply.  The IETF's patent policy and the definition of an IETF "contribution" are set forth in BCP 79; please read it carefully.

**The brief summary:**

- By participating with the IETF, you agree to follow IETF processes and policies.

- If you are aware that any contribution to the IETF is covered by patents or patent applications that are owned by, controlled by, or would benefit you or your sponsor, you must disclose that fact, or not participate in the discussion.

- A participant in any IETF activity acknowledges that written, audio and video records of meetings may be made and may be available to the public, and that recordings of his or her likeness, voice and conduct at the recorded event may be displayed, transmitted, copied, used and promoted in electronic and physical media accessible throughout the world.

- Personal information that you provide to IETF will be handled in accordance with the IETF Privacy Statement set forth at (LINK TO BE PROVIDED).

### Code Components, including full code and code fragments 

Code Components extracted from documents in this repository are licensed under the terms of the Simplified BSD License as specified in Section 4.e of the [http://trustee.ietf.org/trust-legal-provisions.html IETF Trust Legal Provisions] (TLP), and may only be used with the required acknowledgements and disclaimers described therein, unless those Code Components are clearly marked as not intended for inclusion in IETF documents.  The exception is intended to facilitate such activities as interoperability testing and the sharing of examples.  By default, all code is subject to the TLP.


### Additional Detail about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 

The IETF has specific Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosure rules. This is a summary of these rules; see below for references that give more details.

- If you include your own or your employer’s IPR in an IETF contribution, then you must file an IPR disclosure with the IETF.

- If you recognize your own or your employer’s IPR in someone else’s contribution and you are participating in the discussions in the IETF relating to that contribution, then you must file an IPR disclosure with the IETF. Even if you are not participating in the discussion, the IETF still requests that you file an IPR disclosure with the IETF.

- Finally, the IETF requests that you file an IPR disclosure with the IETF if you recognize IPR owned by others in any IETF contribution.

The IETF expects that you file IPR disclosures in a timely manner -- in a period measured in days or weeks, not months. The IETF prefers that the most liberal licensing terms possible be made available; see RFC 3979, Section 8. You may file an IPR disclosure here: http://www.ietf.org/ipr/file-disclosure
