# Draft Boilerplate Change
A draft of a change to the boilerplate for cases where we are publishing something (such as documentation of a vendor-specific mechanism) where the community has consensus to publish, but consensus on the content doesn't make sense:

Current boilerplate:

**This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  It represents the consensus of the IETF community.  It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).**

Proposed boilerplate for this situation:

 **This document is an informational publication by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  It represents technology developed outside the processes of the IETF and the IETF community has determined that it is useful to publish it as an RFC.  It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), but the content of the document does not represent a consensus of the IETF.**
