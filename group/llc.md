This is the main discussion venue for IETF LLC-related topics.

## Projects
### Carbon offset
This project aims to calculate and potentially offset IETF carbon emissions. For further detail, see the [blog post "Towards a net zero IETF (6 May 2022)"](https://www.ietf.org/blog/towards-a-net-zero-ietf/)

IETF community members are encouraged to discuss this project on the [admin-discuss@ietf.org email list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/admin-discuss).

#### Strategy report and plan for 2023

+ C02 footprint calculation and offsetting recommendations report
This [report from EY consultancy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF-Carbon-Neutral-Strategy-20230216.pdf) outlines an approach to calculating and offsetting the IETF's carbon footprint, including input from and discussion with the IETF community conducted in 2023.

+ Discussion at IETF 116
A [side meeting held during IETF 116](https://wiki.ietf.org/meeting/116/sidemeetings) provided additional detail and opporutnities for discussion about C02 calculation and offsetting.

#### Workshops
**Carbon offset strategy**
This set of workshops will provide information about approaches to carbon offsetting and gather community input to help determine a strategy for potentially offsetting the carbon footprint of the IETFâ€™s activities.

**Carbon emissions measurement**
This set of workshops provided information about the global standards-based approach being developed to calculate, as accurately as possible, IETF carbon emissions (initially focused on emissions from IETF meetings). They particularly sought to gather input from the IETF community about how additional data might be gathered from IETF meeting participants that would allow more accurate carbon footprint calculations.
