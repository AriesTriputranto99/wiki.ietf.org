<p>When to AD Spsonsor?</p>
<p>Not all drafts fit into an existing Working Group. Or the draft isn't worth starting a whole new Working Group for. When the document is reasonably small, and does not contain contentious issues, it could be a good candidate for AD sponsorship.</p>
<p>AD sponsored documents skip the Working Group phase and go straight to the IESG state of Publication Requested. Like any other draft, the AD will do an IETF Last Call.</p>
<p>The datatracker process for AD sponsoring is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;Optionally, get and assign a document sheppherd</li>
  <li>Set the Stream to “IETF”</li>
  <li>Set yourself as the Responsible AD</li>
  <li>Set the Working Group state to "Submitted to IESG for Publication"</li>
  <li>Hit the "Begin IESG Processing" button</li>
</ul>
<p>From here on, process the draft like a regular draft. Do an AD review, do an IETF Last Call, Create a Ballot, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
