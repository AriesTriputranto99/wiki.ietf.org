# RDAP RFC Implementation Feature Tables

 As described in Section 2.2 of RFC 6410, RFC progression from Proposed Standard to Internet Standard status requires (among other things) "at least two independent interoperating implementations with widespread deployment and successful operational experience" and "no unused features in the specification that greatly increase implementation complexity". This page exists to document the features specified in RFCs RFC7481, RFC7482, RFC7483, and RFC7484 for which at least two independent interoperating implementations have been identified.

- [Security Services for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), RFC 7481](/group/regext/rfc7481)
- [Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Query Format, RFC 7482, and JSON Responses for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), RFC 7483](/group/regext/rfc7482-rfc7483)
- [Finding the Authoritative Registration Data (RDAP) Service, RFC 7484](/group/regext/rfc7484)
