# SUSTAIN

Welcome to the SUSTAIN PRG wiki!


## An overview of sustainability-related IETF activities

This is meant to make it easier for people to find their way around the IETF regarding sustainability. Any mistakes are our (Sustain RG chairs) own, and please feel free to make corrections or add things (or tell us to do so!).


### Sustainability as the prime goal

- The [Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking (green) WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/green/about/)
- The IAB [Environmental Impacts of Internet Technology (eimpact)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/green/about/) program

### Sustainability as a use case

- The [Time-Variant Routing (tvr) WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tvr/about/)
- Surely there are more? Tell us!

### Events

- In December 2022, the [IAB workshop on Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and Systems (eimpactws)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/eimpactws/about/) was held.
