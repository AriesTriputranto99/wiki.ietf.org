# SUSTAIN

Welcome to the SUSTAIN RG wiki!


## An overview of other sustainability-related IETF/IRTF activities

This is meant to make it easier for people to find their way around the IETF regarding sustainability. Any mistakes are our (Sustain RG chairs) own, and please feel free to make corrections or add things (or tell us to do so!).


### Sustainability as the prime goal

- The [Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking (green) WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/green/about/)
- The IAB [Environmental Impacts of Internet Technology (eimpact)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/green/about/) program

### Sustainability as an element (e.g., a use case)

- The [Time-Variant Routing (tvr) WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tvr/about/)
  - [RFC 9657](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9657/)
- Sustainability is occasionally a topic in the [Network Management Research Group (nmrg)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/nmrg/about/)
  - [draft-soares-nmrg-green-security-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-soares-nmrg-green-security/)

### Events
