##  Schedule 

The schedule for the IAB and IESG events are:

* Monday, 4 May: IESG only
* Tuesday, 5 May: IAB only
* Wednesday, 6 May: Joint IESG and IAB
* Thursday, 7 May: IESG only
* Friday, 8 May: IAB only


## Proposed Topics 


* Review of Programs.  Which ones are still needed?  Who leads (ideally we'll figure this out before the retreat)? Do we need any new programs?

* Additional R.F.C. streams (with Heather)

* RSOC Program size/membership

* [Dave] "Transition Strategies" (Ref: Steve Crocker email thread "Possible IAB agenda item: transition strategies")

* "External affairs", relations to policy world, and travel people want to do

* Communicating the IAB

* I* meeting (both joint day and maybe in detail on alone day)

* IANA transition

* [Erik] Architectural considerations for encapsulation (SPUD / RTG UDP encap for tunneling / etc.)

* [Dave] Technical problems caused by inter-SDO disagreements, including:
  * DHCP vs RA debates caused by 3GPP not supporting DHCP
  * SNMP/YANG vs WS-Management vs others (opendaylight, etc) causing mismatch in information models
  * Mismatch in information models across IoT consortia, as pointed out in plenary talk
  * Others?

* SDN, what's being done, and what clarity we have around what that even is: who (SDO) is doing what? is it clear for the community? do we need to strengthen our liaisons with related SDOs (such as ONF, ...). Should this be discussed with IESG?
