## Current Ideas Queue
The following ideas are current:

### Consolidation
See Jari's blog post on the subject. Lee has notes on a few potential speakers. We've already spoken to Geoff Huston on this subject. We haven't come up with something coherent to say here; the next step in a workshop, the report out from which might involve a plenary.

### Decentralized Internet
Partially related to consolidation, an introduction to current work in decentralization of Internet infrastructure. Melinda to identify possible speakers and invite them for tech talks.

### Straws and Camels
At IETF 101, there was an active topic of discussion in DNSOP how successful protocols get overloaded; this could be expanded into a general topic on the lifecycle of protocol ecosystems.

Next step: Suzanne developing the concept.

### Snowden +N years
Review how the IETF has done on the problem of pervasive surveillance since RFC7258, and look forward to the next challenges in the space. Alissa as IETF privacy expert; externals (Allison to schedule tech chat with Dierdre Mulligan)

### Future of Remote Participation in the IETF
Look forward to technical developments in remote participation technologies, and foster a discussion about how this affects how we work. (Since the IESG runs the meeting program, this seems like one to discuss in close cooperation with the IESG)

### The Web PKI: What we've learned
Wrap-up of recent developments/improvements in the web PKI -- how we got to the messy place, and why it's not as bad as it used to be.

Speakers: TBD

Next step: wait for it to get even more better.

### Privacy update
Corinne Cath suggested the following speakers:

- George Danezis
- Emiliano de Cristofaro
- Ian Goldberg
- Vitaly Shmatikov
- Daniel Solove
- Paul Ohm
- Lilian Edwards

### 5G
- Pablo Sorano (for IETF 108?)

### BGP 30th Anniversary
- Alissa pointed out that this summer is the 30th anniversary of the publication of BPG. Kirk Lougheed? (Also, June 2019 is the 20th anniversary of the publication of HTTP 1.1)

## Past Ideas
These ideas were in an older version of this queue, and have "timed out" or were otherwise not acted upon, but are kept here in list form, as a reminder that we've considered them:

- Challenges to HTTPS Adoption in Media Websites
- IoT and Augmented Reality / Overview of IETF IoT Topics
- Naming and Privacy / Hostname Practice Considered Harmful
- The Cryptographic Lens (watch the YouTube video)
- Data Driven Security
- The Internet and Futurism
- Hub of All Things
- The Lack of Low Justice in the Internet
