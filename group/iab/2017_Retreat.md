## Proposed IAB Topics 

* Focussing on architectural guidance (Lee)
>   Propose to focus work in the coming year on more architectural guidance docs.
>   Goals: Agreement? List of potential documents.
>   Estimated time: 15m
* IETF evolution (Lee)
>   Face to face meetings, remote hubs, virtual meetings, interim meetings (adjacent to other meetings). The nature of meetings seems to be evolving. We say "email is our primary tool," but is that still true, and should it be? Is it possible that there are better ways to get our work done, and how would we know? Consider inputs, problem definitions, contributors, processes, issue tracking, outputs, usability, metrics.
>   Goals: Determine whether there's anything other than "wait and see" the IAB should do.
>   Estimated time: 60m
* Interdependency with other I* (Lee)
>   The IETF is open and transparent because it says so. What's to keep that from changing? How do others know we won't? What would we do if ICANN, IANA, RIRs, or others stopped being so?
>   Goals: Decide there's a problem here, and if so, how to start thinking about it.
>   Estimated time: 15m
* Improving how programs work (Ted)
>    Programs are designed to be a multiplier of forces for topics the IAB has identified as needing exploration or work.  They need a balance of independence and guidance to be effective, and they need the right people.  Can we improve the structures that find us the right people, guide the programs, and support appropriate independence?
   
* Industry certification programs determine how the rubber hits the road. Should the IETF try to influence (some of) these more? If so, how? (Gabriel)
>   Some industry fora influence which protocol are shipped and how, by virtue of including them in certification programs. Arguably, if the IETF and IAB worked more directly with (some) of those entities (e.g., Wi-Fi Alliance, OCF, Thread Group, etc.) this could increase our direct influence. As part of our liaison function, have we considered this? It is not likely to scale in general, but are there some fora worth the trouble? Particularly, in areas that may need it more (e.g., IoT security or lack thereof). 
>   Goal: Decide if this is something we want to do something about and which are potential fora to work with.
>   Time: 15 min

* Review status of Liaison relationships. Hopefully, have statements from Liaisons on current status of their SDOs to review.
* W3C relationship (Mark)
  Discussion of the state of the Liaison, related groups such as WHATWG, etc.
* Possible workshop on Internationalized Domain Names & Resolution Contexts (IDN) (Ted, Suzanne?)
>   The MINC proposal is one possible take on this, but there are many more ways to tackle this.  Identifying which one(s), if any, to put effort into is the core goal of this discussion.
* Low latency (Jari, Jeff)
>   Discussion, with the goal of building a better understanding of broader industry trends and their effects on the Internet. Some Internet improvements relate to latency.  For instance, improvements in radio communications or the recent work in IETF transport, security, and web protocols.  There are also potential applications where latency is in an important role. And modern networking systems offer many tools for building low-latency networks. We should discuss the developments from the point of view of the Internet architecture. Is there something notable going on? Are there potential stresses that the strive for low-latency applications may bring? Can the IAB say or do something useful here, or is this merely a case of community working further on the topics that interest them? A to-be-published draft-arkko-arch-low-latency will provide some background on this topic.
* 5G and potential impacts to IETF work (Jari, Jeff)
>   Discussion, with the goal of building a better understanding and map of where we are. Work is ongoing to develop 5G networks, and the first major release of the standards for that is only 14 months away. While much of the effort is on the cellular industry and 3GPP, there are certainly impacts elsewhere, both in terms of standards and open source efforts. What do we know about the impacts on IETF standards? Are there new major uses of Internet standards in 5G that did not exist in previous generations (e.g., EAP)? Are there dependencies to ongoing work that is used in 5G or some of the open source projects that it relies on (e.g., NSH)? Are there requirements for new work? Are there areas of discussion or confusion that we should understand (e.g., slicing and whether it needs anything new from Internet perspective)?
* Alignment with ISOC (Allison wrt IRTF, Olaf?)

* RSOC Membership (Robert)
>   Continuation of discussion from IETF98
>   Goals: Criteria for new recruits. Names of people to recruit. Make any immediate changes we agree to.
>   Estimated time: 45m
> 
* ISE Appointment (Robert)
>   Discussion of state/progress of search committee and planning
>   Goals:
>     Document characteristics and requirements the search committee should be looking for. 
>     Build higher confidence in schedule, plan for interviews and selection
>   Estimated time: 60m
> 
* Evolution of the ISE Role (Robert?, Joe?) (Robert suggests Joe should drive)
>   Is the current ISE model the right one going forward?
>   Goals: 
>     Discuss and start documenting how we think the role should change
>     Identify what process would need to be followed to implement change  
>   Estimated time: 120m
  
* Relationship with Unicode (Ted, Mark)
>   This is currently strained and needs a reset.  The goal here is to identify strategies and timelines for a useful reset
> 
* IAB expertise description (Robert)
>    Goal: Provide Nomcom with an updated description of the IAB positions
>    Estimated time: 30m
