* IAB calendar: [Subscribe](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/ietf.org_k88jdeojmvn249q37ain3ojepc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

This is the schedule for the IAB Full Board meetings between IETF 122 (March 2025) and IETF 125 (March 2026). This schedule follows the [committee model](/group/iab/committee-model) of meeting.

The IAB will hold in-person Full Board Meetings at IETF meetings, during the IAB retreat, and virtually.

Virtual meetings will be 2-hour slots from 06:00-08:00 Pacific Time, throughout the year. Reserved meeting slots are planned to not be used, but should be reserved on calendars in case there is an emergency reason to meet. Reserved meeting slots should be determined to be used 1-2 weeks in advance.

Committees of the IAB will hold meetings between Full Board Meetings. These meetings will be published in the IAB calendar, and can use reserved timeslots at 07:00-08:00 Pacific Time and 14:00-15:00 Pacific Time, throughout the year.
