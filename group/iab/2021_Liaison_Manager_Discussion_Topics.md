Purpose: The IAB has realized that in the last few years, many of its liaison managers are potentially not getting the support and attention they need when filling the liaison manager role. The purpose of today's discussion is really just to have a dialog about what is working and what might need improvement. Though we have some "seed" questions, we're really looking for an interactive dialog ideally.

1. How much time do you spend a month interacting with your organization
2. How much prior knowledge of the organization do you need to fill your role?
3. Have you written the IAB with updates about important topics? If so, how frequently. If not, why not?
4. Do you feel that the IAB liaison program is effectively communicating with your organization? Why/Why Not?
5. Is there anything the IAB can do to help you?

Closing: thank you for your time and your service to the IETF
