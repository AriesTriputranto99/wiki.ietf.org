# RSAB Stream Representative

With the publication of [RFC9280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9280.html#name-rfc-series-approval-board-r) the [RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rsab/about/) was created in early summer 2022. The RSAB consists of stream representatives for each stream (IAB, IETF, IRTF, and IS) and the RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE). The IAB stream representative can be an IAB member or someone appointed by the IAB. Further the IETF executive director and a representative from the RPC are ex-offico members.

To high-level summarize from RFC9280, the RSAB has two tasks:
- Approval of draft from the RSWG (see steps 6-15 in the [RFC9280 workflow](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9280.html#name-workflow)); in particular the RSAB is responsible for run a [community call for comments](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9280.html#name-community-calls-for-comment)
- Policy decisions requested by the RPC if an policy in an RFC is unclear or missing (see last bullet point in [Overview of the Model](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9280.html#name-overview-of-the-model))

To ensure a smooth approval process, RSAB members are expected to participate or at least monitor the work in the RSWG. RSWG initially tried in-person meeting during the IETF week but due to too many conflicts they changed to online meetings which so far have also only occurred in a very limited way. However, there is often quite active email discussion.

The RSAB meetings are open for observers, also the in-person meetings. And the RSAB list archives are public. Usually the RSAB will check for topics for every IETF meeting but RSAB might only meet occasionally, mostly depending on document progress in the RSWG or requests by the RPC. In addition to the official RSAB meeting, the RPC might request a stream manager meeting to update the stream managers about current projects and request early input; usually the stream manager meeting will be co-located with the RSAB meeting but might not be public. Usually the stream manager and stream representative are the same person.
