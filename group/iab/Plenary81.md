> Designers of Internet protocols, services, and applications are increasingly being confronted with challenges associated with protecting the privacy of individual Internet users. Past efforts to build privacy features into Internet standards have met with mixed results, while attempts to fully comprehend and document the privacy consequences of Internet protocols more broadly remain in a nascent stage.

>  The web platform in particular has become an arena where privacy issues are emerging with increasing frequency. This plenary will explore the web privacy "tussle" by providing a diversity of perspectives on the tensions and motivations behind some of the privacy struggles that are currently exhibiting themselves on the web. By examining past attempts at addressing privacy issues within Internet standards and technologies, the panel provides an opportunity for the IETF community to better understand the aspects of privacy that are relevant to protocol design and the appropriate scope of privacy work in the IETF.
