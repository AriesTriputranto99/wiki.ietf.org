# EODIR Liaison

The IAB maintains a liaison to EODIR to be informed about education and and outreach activities as well as provide input about the IAB or IAB outreach activities when needed.

Regarding outreach, note that EODIR is mostly focused on new participants and outreach activities related to that. The IAB coordinates outreach activities of leadership including e.g. fora related to policy in coordination with ISOC.

All information about EODIR can be found on the wiki [here](/group/eodir). EODIR manages, beside new participant activities (guides, social hour, sunday training, quick connections, ...) and outreach, also chair training, the deep dive, and optionally other tutorials.

EODIR usually meets Friday morning during IETF weeks and might occasionally also hold interim meetings. Beyond enabling communication between the IAB and EODIR, the liaison might of course also actively engage in some EODIR activities (which are mostly supported by the secretariat as well).
