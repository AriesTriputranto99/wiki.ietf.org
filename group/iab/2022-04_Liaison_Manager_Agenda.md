Goals/Agenda:

1. Administrative:
  - Thank everyone for their service
  - Introduce Deborah as a new liaison coordinator (and say goodbye to slowly-fading Wes)
  - and appreciate the reports sent to the IAB
  - liaison tool access list emailed out -- please check it
2. Feedback goals:
  - reach out to all managers to check how things are going
  - identify places where additional help is needed
  - identify other individuals that can serve when current managers step down
3. Other:
  - promote cross-liaison-manager communication, which is why we're holding group discussions this time
  - feedback on the new iab-liaison-coordinator method of IAB connectivity
  - IETF leadership is generally seeking new volunteers for leadership roles (chairs, etc)
  
## Session 1
### attendance
Daniel Migault
Geoff Huston
Peter Koch
Russ Housley
Scott Mansfield
Stephan Wenger
Tim Wicinski
Tommy, Wes and Deborah

### Topics
#### cross area group population
- stephan doesn't have a good replacement
  - other mpeg members do come to the ietf, but their devotion is to mpeg not to the IETF
  - 3gpp2 doesn't exist any longer, and imtc which has dissolved into another organization
- some groups have really nothing to do, so replacement isn't critical
- should some liaisonships be dropped?

#### cross-SDO specification reviews and reuse of IETF technologies
- what do we do about organizations taking IETF stuff and misusing it
  - yang modules in particular are a real problem with many external mistakes, etc
  - can the liaison tool be used for external review requests for things like this
  - this is compounded by the fact that many external documents are closed and not available for review
  - Does ITU-T need an additional liaison manager in order to help review
  - explain to the other organization they may need help in developing specifications and what may happen if they develop in proprietary viewerships

### How to get feedback from the IAB in sticky topics
- how do we deal with roles where opinions and common representation of IETF viewpoints is required
- IAB liaisons reach out to the IAB for help and guidance when possible
- discussion specifically about the GWG
- the liaison managers should be liaisons with the IETF as a whole, not just the IAB

### iab-coordination feedback points
- 6-12 month group meetings should work well
- group mailing lists might need their own shared list -- icann-liaisons@ietf eg


## Session 2
### Attendance
Alexeandre Petrescu
Barry Leiba
Allison Mankin

### notes
- Allison needs a replacement
  - Needs travel to get to the Seoul and related to TCP
  - It's really a prelude to things that will happen in the ITU
  - National bodies attend it (dept of state rep, etc)
  - Need someone young willing to do this
  - Ideally one person that has ties to an existing government in order to get document access (see below).
    - Potentially someone in the British government
- open/closed transition difficulty
  - TC204 allows invites for other people
  - promote descriptions of what work is being done when advertising new liaison openings
  - some groups make obtaining documents even for the official liaisons difficult
    - national arrangements trump the cross-SDO access requirements

### frequency / management / etc
- group meetings seem to be a good idea
- should liaison managers list be a discussion group: yes
  - could be used for reporting and for questions, current issues, etc

### other notes
- barry is willing to give an iabopen presentation about m3aawg
- alexandre would be willing too
- participants found these chats helpful
