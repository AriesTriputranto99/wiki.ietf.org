# Relationship with ETSI
The IETF does currently not maintain a formal liaison relationship with ETSI. The ETSI portal reports the relation as "Informal Collaboration". See https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/AgreementView/AgreementDetail.asp?AgrID=23

There is overlap between IETF working groups and ETSI technical committee and collaboration happens on technical level among individuals that participate in both groups, inline with IETFâ€™s general approach to liaison management where we aim to keep liaison relationships as informal as possible (see RFC4052).

Liaison Statement can be sent without having a formal liaison relationship that is managed by a liaison coordinator, as both organisations have done so in the past. Liaison statements are usually send to the ETSI technical coordinator of a respective group as listed in the ETSO portal: https://portal.etsi.org/home.aspx

The also the ETSI organisation chart for further contact information: https://portal.etsi.org/People/ETSI-Organisation-Chart

And a full list of committees here: https://www.etsi.org/committees
