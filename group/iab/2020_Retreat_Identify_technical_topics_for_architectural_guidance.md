A slide deck posted on email.

### Jari
There seems to be two categories of things here:

1/ Process. How to do it. What we are allowed to do, how to organize, etc. Personally, I'm fed up with meta discussions and would rather get to substance! :-)

2/ The substance. What are the topics? What advice we can or should give, and what exactly do we say, on the specific topics?
