**Network Performance Measurement**

From Alissa's email proposal:

> Although network performance measurement has been a topic of research, 
> standardization, and development for decades, recent efforts to create 
> national, regional, and global access network measurement testbeds and 
> frameworks are drawing renewed interest. These efforts seek to provide 
> consistent measurements of fine-grained performance metrics such as 
> packet loss, delay, and throughput, as well as higher order tests to 
> capture quality of experience with respect to specific applications and 
> services. Some standardized metrics and tests exist, including those 
> developed in the IPPM WG, but a unified framework for observing and 
> reporting the quality metrics that define usersâ€™ experiences across 
> different networks has yet to be developed. This plenary will explore 
> the approaches, results, and challenges involved with existing 
> performance measurement efforts from around the world with an eye 
> towards understanding the potential role for standardization broadly and 
> IETF/IRTF activity specifically.
