## IETF 90: Topology & Geography

> Since network gear, links, and the nodes they connect must be in some 
> specific physical place, there is always a relationship between 
> geography and network topology.  The flow of data through that topology 
> has generally, however, been relatively independent of the geography.  
> Recently, some public policy proposals have tried to tie the flow of 
> data on the network to national or regional boundaries.  This panel will 
> discuss the relationship between geography and network topology from 
> three points of view.  The IXmaps project at the University of Toronto 
> attempts to analyse traffic to understand where it is going with, so 
> far, a particularly Canadian focus.  ISOC's Internet Exchange efforts 
> are focussed on improving local internconnections within underserved 
> regions.  And CAIDA has been undertaking analysis of Internet traffic, 
> including its relationship to geography, for many years.  Each panellist 
> will make a brief presentation, and then we will discuss the 
> implications of their findings.
