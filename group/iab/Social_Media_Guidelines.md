# IAB Social Media Guidelines

## Social media platforms and accounts

The IAB maintains accounts on selected social media platforms. Since a goal for these platforms is to reach individuals beyond those already aware of or connected to the IAB or IETF in other ways, such as mailing lists, platforms have been selected based on reach to these audiences. Platforms are reviewed at least once per year, and also when any other significant change (in either the platform or environment affecting the platform) suggests doing so:

- Twitter/X: http://twitter.com/intarchboard
- Mastodon: https://mastodon.online/@intarchboard
- BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/intarchboard.bsky.social
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/internet-architecture-board/

The IAB also has a dedicated playlist on the IETF YouTube channel.

IAB members who maintain individual accounts on these platforms are encouraged to follow IAB accounts and to reshare posts and content.

## Content and engagement strategy

IAB Social media channels are primarily used in “broadcast” mode with a goal of raising awareness about IAB activities and promoting engagement through IAB-owned channels. Exchanges with other accounts on the platforms are generally out of scope. Occasionally, actionable information conveyed to the social media accounts require follow up, usually directing to other channels, such as support@ietf.org.

The following events prompt accompanying posts to social media accounts:

- IAB workshop announcements (e.g. Call for papers)
- Regular IAB reports to the community accompanying IETF meetings
- Publication of an IAB RFC
- IAB Statement releases
- Liaison and other appointments
- Blog posts related to IAB activities

Other posting guidelines:

- Tag accounts of related organizations (IETF, IRTF, etc.)
- Use established hashtags, usually event or technology-related (e.g. #IETF118, #QUIC)
- Establish a clear call to action with an appropriate link (e.g. to a webpage)
- Include relevant images whenever possible
- Encourage re-sharing by other accounts as appropriate (e.g. reposting research-relevant workshop announcements via IRTF social media accounts)

## Editorial process

Based on a regularly reviewed and updated editorial calendar, posts are created and published by either the Executive Administrative Manager or the IETF Director of Communications and Operations. Ongoing guidance is provided and sought, as needed, from the IAB Outreach Coordinator.

## Future considerations

Further aspects to consider are whether and how the IAB social media presence might be used to engage actively with other accounts on respective platforms, including with accounts of other organizations as well as individuals.
