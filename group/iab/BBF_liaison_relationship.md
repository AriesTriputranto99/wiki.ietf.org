# Broadband Forum (BBF) Liaison Relationship

***_Under Construction_ - Note: blatantly copied from the ISO Liaison Relationship page to be used as a template/model***

Current liaison relationships with BBF are with the IETF, the IAB and/or ISOC.  
BBF information concerning liaison partners, including liaison communication process, can be found here: https://www.broadband-forum.org/about-bbf/liaison-partners
*Note: while the BBF only lists "IETF" the relationship is actually with the three organizations above.

The BBF is a company membership organization and as such their work in progress and much of the liaison information, e.g., liaison officers, liaison repository, etc., are private access restricted to members only.  See the links and contact information on the BBF liaison web pages above for details.

Because BBF is a membership organization, the following should be considered in communication with the BBF:
- as a company membership organization, individuals attending the BBF and with access to BBF private materials and information are not at liberty to share said information unless it has been explicitly conveyed via official, written BBF liaison to the IETF, IESG and/or specific working groups.  Individuals conveying work in progress, or other private BBF information  (including BBF contributions) outside of a written liaison are most likely in violation of their BBF membership agreement.  Such occurances should be brought to the attention of the IETF Liaison Manager to the BBF AND the BBF Liaison Officer to the IETF.
- the distinction between coordination, cooperation and collaboration (including "joint meetings") should be strictly maintained.  While engagement and communication between stanards organizations and consortia are encouraged, these should be limited to coordination (i.e., 
- The BBF Liaison Officer to IETF is the only individual authorized to speak on behalf of the BBF.  Even then they must do so within the confines of explicit, written liaison to the IETF. (Per BBF process, only explicit, written liaisons represent an official BBF membership consensus view and information.)  Individuals speaking or conveying information beyond what is contained in explicit written liaison AND without authorization from the BBF Liaison Officer are not authorized to speak on behalf of the BBF and are likely in violation of their company's BBF membership agreement.

<Editor's note: the following text applies to all liaison relationships and as such should be placed on a common, parent wiki page, not part of every individual liaison relationship page.  
=== Begin common text ===
RFC2026 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2026#section-1) delegates all responsibilities from ISOC in the Internet Standards process to the IAB and IESG:

>   The
>   Internet Standards process is an activity of the Internet Society
>   that is organized and managed on behalf of the Internet community by
>   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
>   Steering Group (IESG).

The IAB's role in the management of external liaison is described in its charter (RFC2850 - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2850#section-2) as following:

> (f) External Liaison
>   The IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF and the
>   Internet Society in technical liaison relationships with other
>   organizations concerned with standards and other technical and
>   organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet. Liaisons
>   are kept as informal as possible and must be of demonstrable value in
>   improving the quality of IETF specifications.  Individual members of
>   the IETF are appointed as liaisons to other organizations by the IAB
>   or IESG as appropriate.

A such the IAB is responsible for maintaining all liaison relationships with ISO (held by either ISOC or the IETF LLC) including management of the liaison manager role.

## Creating new ISO liaison relationships
ISO requires in their directives (section on Eligibility - section 1.17.6 as of 2023-07-05) a legal entity as the organization to liaise with. Before the IETF LLC was established, ISOC was considered the legal umbrella of the IETF (see RFC2031). With the establishment of the IETF LLC all new liaison relationships have been and should beee established directly with the LLC.

The establishment of new liaison relationships with ISO groups, after approval by the IAB, requires to fill and send a form (as linked in the ISO directives). An exampled of this form can be found in the appendix of this LS: https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1767/

It is recommend to also send all future applications as LSes in order to hold a public record. The LS was send to the Committee Manager of the respective committee. It is recommend to informally approach the Committee Manager in advance of sending the application (usually as part of the IAB discussion and approval step).

## Document access
A category A liaison with an ISO/IEC committee provides organizational level access to documents and full participation in meetings. For this purpose a liaison manager is named. Organizational access to documents can be requested to the liaison manager by any member of the organization, e.g. for the purpose of reviewing dependencies in IETF Internet-Drafts. Non-public ISO documents cannot be further re-distributed or published.

Published ISO Standards are not available from ISO except through purchase. For reviewing in the IETF that requires assess to published ISO International Standards (IS), ISO often provides documents that a) available under the document distribution terms of ISO for liaisons, and b) technically identical to the published international standard. In most cases that is the “Final Draft International Standard” (FDIS). The FDIS is usually available from the document registry of the relevant ISO committee, or (if that fails) through the ISO committee manager.

## SC29
SC29 is the umbrella committee for MPEG and JPEG. MPEG’s current webpage is www.mpeg.org, and JPEG’s is www.jpeg.org.

*Note: Leonardo Chiariglione founded MPEG and headed MPEG for decades but he now runs a competing organization (MPAI). His old MPEG webpage is stale.*
