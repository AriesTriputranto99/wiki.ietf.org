# ISO liaison relationship

Current liaison relationships with ISO are either listed with ISOC or the IETF (due to historical reason - see further below).

ISO lists all liaison relationships with ISOC here: https://www.iso.org/organization/9418.html

ISO lists all liaison relationships with the IETF here: https://www.iso.org/organization/8088116.html

All these liaison relationships are maintained by the IAB and are category A liaisons, providing full participation and document access. For further information see the ISO Directives (see section on "Liaison with other organisations"): https://www.iso.org/directives-and-policies.html

RFC2026 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2026#section-1) delegates all responsibilities from ISOC in the Internet Standards process to the IAB and IESG:

>   The
>   Internet Standards process is an activity of the Internet Society
>   that is organized and managed on behalf of the Internet community by
>   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
>   Steering Group (IESG).

The IAB's role in the management of external liaison is described in its charter (RFC2850 - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2850#section-2) as following:

> (f) External Liaison
>   The IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF and the
>   Internet Society in technical liaison relationships with other
>   organizations concerned with standards and other technical and
>   organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet. Liaisons
>   are kept as informal as possible and must be of demonstrable value in
>   improving the quality of IETF specifications.  Individual members of
>   the IETF are appointed as liaisons to other organizations by the IAB
>   or IESG as appropriate.

A such the IAB is responsible for maintaining all liaison relationships with ISO (held by either ISOC or the IETF LLC) including management of the liaison manager role.

## Creating new ISO liaison relationships
ISO requires in their directives (section on Eligibility - section 1.17.6 as of 2023-07-05) a legal entity as the organization to liaise with. Before the IETF LLC was established, ISOC was considered the legal umbrella of the IETF (see RFC2031). With the establishment of the IETF LLC all new liaison relationships have been and should beee established directly with the LLC.

The establishment of new liaison relationships with ISO groups, after approval by the IAB, requires to fill and send a form (as linked in the ISO directives). An exampled of this form can be found in the appendix of this LS: https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1767/

It is recommend to also send all future applications as LSes in order to hold a public record. The LS was send to the Committee Manager of the respective committee. It is recommend to informally approach the Committee Manager in advance of sending the application (usually as part of the IAB discussion and approval step).

## Document access
A category A liaison with an ISO/IEC committee provides organizational level access to documents and full participation in meetings. For this purpose a liaison manager is named. Organizational access to documents can be requested to the liaison manager by any member of the organization, e.g. for the purpose of reviewing dependencies in IETF Internet-Drafts. Non-public ISO documents cannot be further re-distributed or published.

Published ISO Standards are not available from ISO except through purchase. For reviewing in the IETF that requires assess to published ISO International Standards (IS), ISO often provides documents that a) available under the document distribution terms of ISO for liaisons, and b) technically identical to the published international standard. In most cases that is the “Final Draft International Standard” (FDIS). The FDIS is usually available from the document registry of the relevant ISO committee, or (if that fails) through the ISO committee manager.

## SC29
SC29 is the umbrella committee for MPEG and JPEG. MPEG’s current webpage is www.mpeg.org, and JPEG’s is www.jpeg.org.

*Note: Leonardo Chiariglione founded MPEG and headed MPEG for decades but he now runs a competing organization (MPAI). His old MPEG webpage is stale.*
