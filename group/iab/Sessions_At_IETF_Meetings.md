# Requesting IAB sessions at an IETF meeting


The IAB may choose to convene a meeting during regular WG session time at an IETF meeting, e.g. the ISOpen meeting at IETF 120. These meetings are explicitly **not** BOFs; they are IAB-hosted meetings.

When the IAB decides to hold a meeting during regular session time, they should:

* inform the IESG so that they are aware
* send email to support@ietf.org with all of the details required to put the meeting on the agenda
    * name of meeting and acronym (must correspond to a group in the Datatracker; one will need to be created if it doesn't already exist)
    * session length
    * expected # of attendees
    * chairs (if known)
    * conflicts
