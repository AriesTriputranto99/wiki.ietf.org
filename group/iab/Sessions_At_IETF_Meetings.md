# Requesting IAB sessions at an IETF meeting


The IAB may choose to convene a meeting during regular WG session time at an IETF meeting, e.g. the [ISOpen](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/isopen/about/) meeting at [IETF 120](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/120/session/isopen). These meetings are explicitly **not** BOFs; they are IAB-hosted meetings.

When the IAB decides to hold a meeting during regular session time, they should:

* inform the IESG so that they are aware
* send email to the Secretariat (support@ietf.org) with all of the details required to put the meeting on the agenda:
    * name of meeting and acronym (must correspond to a group in the Datatracker; one will need to be created if it doesn't already exist)
    * session length
    * expected # of attendees
    * chairs (if known)
    * conflicts
    
The email to the Secretariat should be sent before the cutoff date for scheduling requests.
