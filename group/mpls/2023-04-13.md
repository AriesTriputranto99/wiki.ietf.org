# MPLS Open DT Meeting 2023-04-13

## Agenda
1. Action Items
    Tarek
    
1. Discussion on early allocating the MNA label
    Chairs, Stewart
    The DT is not mandated to take decissions, the decission on early code point allocatiions is taken by chairs and the responsible AD.
    This has been been put on the agenda to help the chairs/AD to take a decisiion.
    
    
1. Discussion on closing the MPLS Open DT
    Chairs
    The discussion started at the Joint meeting at in IETF 116.
    This discussion is on a "if time allows basis", if we can't finish there will be another meeing next week.
    Once we converged, the working group list will be poleed, and consensus called by the chairs.
    There seem to be three opinions:
    - keeping the MPLS Open DT helps us keep the speed in producing the MNA standards
    - we are past the point where the design team is necessary, we can go back to do the MNA work according the normal working group procedures
    - it is desirable to go back to go back to normal working group procedures, however:
    -- there are things that we should achieve before doing this, e.g. understand if PSD is needed, criteria for allocation of the MNA label, etc.
    - it has als been pointed out that the chair can can call Open DT meetings if this is found necessary, e.g. if authors/editors want to dicuss "their" documents
