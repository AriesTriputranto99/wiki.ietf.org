# Open MNA Calls Charter (version 1, posted 2023-04-28)


   - The goal of the Open MNA Calls are to provide early review and
     comment proposals to help the MPLS WG flush out issues and
     points for discussion and decision thereby speeding up the
     document development process. The calls provide a discussion
     forum to support authors, editors and chairs.
   - Another objective of the Open MNA Calls is ensure that new MNA
     solutions and approaches meet the agreed MNA use cases,
     requirements, and framework. MNA solutions should be converged
     to the greatest extent possible.
   - Anyone interested to join the Open MNA Calls may join by using
     the call invite.
   - No technical decisions will be taken in the Open MNA Calls,
     just agreement on proposals or recommendations to the chairs
     and working group. All technical decisions will be made by the
     MPLS working group on the working group mailing list.
   - Open MNA Call notes (including a list of participants) will be
     sent to the MPLS WG mailing list following each call.
