# OS current practices
   
By default, most modern OSes (especially mobile ones) do implement some MAC address randomization policies. Table 1 summarizes current practices for Androiod and iOS, as the time of writing [RFC9724](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9724) (the original source is available at [Private MAC address on iOS 14](https://www.fing.com/news/private-mac-address-on-ios-14), latest wayback machine's snapshot available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230905111429/https://www.fing.com/news/private-mac-address-on-ios-14)) and also includes updates based on findings from the authors.

        Table 1: Android and iOS MAC Address Randomization Practices

In September 2021, we have performed some additional tests to evaluate OSes that are widely used behave regarding MAC address randomization. Table 2 summarizes our findings; the rows in the table show whether the OS performs address randomization per network (PNGM according to the taxonomy introduced in Section 6 of [RFC9724](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9724), performs address randomization per new connection (PSGM), performs address randomization daily (PPGM with a period of 24 hours), supports configuration per SSID, supports address randomization for scanning, and supports address randomization for scanning by default.

      Table 2: Observed Behavior in Different OSes (as of September
                                  2021)

According to ["MAC Randomization Behavior"](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/wifi-mac-randomization-behavior), starting in Android 12, Android uses non-persistent randomization in the following situations:
   
   - A network suggestion application specifies that non-persistant randomization be used for the network (through an API).
   - The network is an open network that hasn't encountered a captive portal and an internal config option is set to do so (by default it is not).
