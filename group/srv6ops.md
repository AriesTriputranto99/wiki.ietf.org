# Welcome to the SRv6OPS WG Wiki

This Wiki contains additional information for the IETF [SRv6OPS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/srv6ops/about/) working group. Refer [datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/srv6ops/documents/) for the latest state of any draft. 

## Prep for IETF 120

- See [draft agenda](https://notes.ietf.org/SRv6OPS-Agenda-IETF120?view)

## Draft Analysis

### SRv6 Deployment and Operation Problem Summary
[draft-liu-srv6ops-problem-summary-03](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liu-srv6ops-problem-summary/)

- Make sure that the drafts align to our charter and suggest to limit this to Operational Problem Summary
- Currently bare bones, need meet to describe issues and not be a wishlist of new features!
- Limit front page authors to 5

### IPv6 Address Assignment for SRv6
[draft-liu-srv6ops-sid-address-assignment-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liu-srv6ops-sid-address-assignment/)

- Does it align with draft-ietf-6man-sids?

### Best Practices for Protection of SR Networks
[draft-liu-srv6ops-sr-protection-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liu-srv6ops-sr-protection/)

- Please limit to SRv6 only, any text related to SR-MPLS is out of scope! 
- It lacks operational issues or guidance, it feels more like a list of everything! 

### Alternate Marking Deployment Status and Considerations
[draft-zhou-srv6ops-am-deployment-status-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zhou-srv6ops-am-deployment-status/)

- More clearer guidance is needed

### Use Cases and Requirements for IPv6 enhancement techniques in cloud 
[draft-he-yi-srv6ops-ipv6-enhancemnet-in-cloud-uc-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-he-yi-srv6ops-ipv6-enhancemnet-in-cloud-uc/)

- What does it mean to have an SRv6 agent in virtual incloud router?
- Not much meat!
