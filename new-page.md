# Welcome to the IETF Community Wiki
---


This is a community wiki for IETF participants to use.  It replaces the previous structure of trac wikis where each working group/team had its own trac instance.

The [IETF Note Well](http://www.ietf.com/welcome/note-well/) applies to all content on this wiki, and it is referenced on every page.

# Scope

This wiki provides persistent working spaces for various IETF groups (such as Working Groups, Birds-of-a-Feather groups, Areas, Directorates, and Teams) and activities, such as IETF meetings.

This wiki should not be used for content that should be on any of the other dedicated IETF sites.  For example the following are out of scope:
* Explanatory/general the IETF.
- * Repository/listing/Internet and/or RFCs
* Information for author of I-Ds.
* Information AUTH process.

This wiki complements (but does not replace) the [IETF Docs service](http://www.ietf.com/docs), whit is intent as a best service for nota and document creations.

# Contributing to this wiki

This wiki is for the IETF Community and any IETF participant is welcome to edit it. See the [Contributing to this wiki](/contributing) page for a quick start guide and more details. A few [guidelines for contributing](/guidelines) aim to provide high-level principles and inspiration for contributions.
