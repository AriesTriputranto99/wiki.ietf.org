# IETF 111 Hackathon

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is holding a Hackathon to encourage developers to discuss, collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards.

**When:** Monday - Friday, July 19 - 23, 2021 
**Where:** [IETF 111](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/111/) is an online only meeting and so is the Hackathon.
**Sign up for the Hackathon here:** Register.
**View the list of registered Hackathon attendees:** [Here](https://registration.ietf.org/111/participants/hackathon/)
**IETF gather.town link:** 


Keep up to date by subscribing to https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon

The Hackathon is free to attend and is open to everyone. It is a collaborative event, not a competition. Any competition is friendly and in the spirit of advancing the pace and relevance of new and evolving internet standards.

## Meeting Materials

 -   Code can be accessed from [IETF Hackathon GitHub](https://github.com/ietf-hackathon), or from links provided within project descriptions below.
     -   Request to be added to IETF GitHub organization by sending your Github ID to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com. 
 -   Results of hackathon projects should be uploaded to https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf111-project-presentations. See the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf111-project-presentations/blob/master/README.md) for details. 
 
 ## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites

* Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in this wiki in the "Projects Included in Hackathon" section
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
* Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](/meeting/111/hackathon/lost&found).
* Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, or something similar will help
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose
* Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * [IETF Hackathon GitHub Org](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon)
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com
* Training Materials
   * Network programmability based on IETF standard protocols and models is relevant to many projects. Self paced online training modules are available on Cisco DevNet. Access is free but a !DevNet account is required. You can login or create an account quickly with this IETF Hackathon specific link [IETF 111 Hackathon](https://developer.cisco.com/join/ietf111)
      * [Intro to Coding Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/fundamentals )
      * [REST API Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/rest-api-fundamentals) 
      * [Introduction to Model Driven Programmability (YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF)](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)

   * Champions for each technology are encouraged to share any other things they think would be helpful in preparation for the hackathon
* Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did on during the closing session at the end of the hackathon
    * [https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf111-project-presentations] is for IETF hackathon participants to upload their hackathon project presentations
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com your GitHub ID at your earliest convenience
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos


## Network

 Access to virtual IETF network

  -  The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network while attending the meeting remotely.

How to: http://wiki.ietf.org/meeting/111/hackathon/hacknet_instructions


## Webex sessions for teams

Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for use until the end of August 2021. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name".   
  
## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the hackathon list, it is recommended to monitor both the hackathon wiki and the list as the hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](/meeting/111/hackathon/teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members.

The hackathon kickoff and the closing presentations will be available via Meetecho. The hackathon Jabber room may be used for general and project specific communication.

  -  Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules. 

##  Projects Included in Hackathon (add your project using the template provided at end of project list)

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for first time IETFers and/or first time hackathoners. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. '*'. If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a * at the end of your project name.
