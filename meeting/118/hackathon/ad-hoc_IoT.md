# Header
Based on Internet Draft https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-foglar-ipv6-ull-routing/ an experimental network has been created in Germany with the prefix AF49/16.
The 6Tree network is ideal vor IoT thanks to
- IPv6
- Intrinsic security thanks to verified IPv6 prefix
- low latency thanks to hierarchical network structure

Participants are invited to test and evaluate the 6Tree network, for example latency.
Instant access to this network is possible with a (Linux) PC and a mobile phone with German telephone number. A phone call is used for payment and verified prefix generation. For non-German residents pre-paid SIM cards will be provided.
