# Side Meetings at IETF 118
---

IETF participants often organize side meetings around [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings) to discuss topics of interest to some portion of the IETF community. The IETF supports [Public Side Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/side-meetings/) by setting aside rooms that can be booked by participants and by providing basic A/V support and a WebEx meeting room for remote participants. These rooms and this page are not to be used for [Private Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/side-meetings/).

This wiki is used to book the side meeting rooms and share details of the topics, contact persons, dates and times, and other information. This page provides details for side meetings around  [IETF 118 Prague](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/118/).

# Guidelines for public side meetings

* To begin, lunch slots are blocked off in case these rooms are needed for other IETF meetings and events. The week of October 30, some lunch slots will be opened up if they are available for side meetings.

* Side meetings posted here are open for any registered IETF participant to attend.

* All side meetings are subject to the [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well).

* Working group business needs to occur during scheduled working group sessions in ways that comply with [RFC 2026](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2026.html)  and [RFC 2418](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html), which is not the case for informal side meetings.

* Side meetings may be used for design teams or other informal discussions related to working groups.

* Side meetings do not record attendance ("blue sheets") as is done during IETF working groups sessions.

* Active consent from participants should be sought by organizers for any side meeting that is recorded.

* Side meeting dates and times should be listed in Prague local time, UTC+1 (Please note that Europe and the USA end Daylight Savings at different times before the meeting, so pay attention to your time zones!). For help converting time zones, please use a tool like [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html). 

* Please provide a calendar invitation (an `.ics` file) for a side meeting by putting the link in the appropriate column below.

# Audio/Visual provision and remote participation
Each room will be equipped with a [Meeting Owl](https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3) 360-degree camera with microphone and speaker to facilitate remote participation. 

We provide a Chromebook with a preconfigured WebEx room in each side meeting room. The Chromebook is also configured to work with Zoom and Microsoft Teams; however you must login with your own account details to use anything other than WebEx.  

The Webex info is as follows:

Palmovka 1/2 (40U): https://ietf.webex.com/meet/ietfsidemeeting2. Please review [room-specific instructions](/large_side_meeting_room_-_chromebook_instructions.pdf) for managing your side meeting. 

Karlin 4 (16U): https://ietf.webex.com/meet/sidemeetingietf1. Please review [room-specific instructions](/small_side_meeting_room_-_chromebook_instructions.pdf) for managing your meeting.


Other platforms including Zoom, Teams, and etc. can also be used.


# Two step process to schedule a side meeting 

**1. Enter your meeting information (day, time, name, area, contact, description, room links) into the [meeting information table](#meetinginfo) below. Note this is not the room reservation. The actual room reservation is step 2.**

**2. Please choose the day and time that best accommodates your group and complete the room reservation by entering the meeting name in the tables further down. This is the actual room reservation. If the meeting is not in the room table, the room is not reserved!**

# Step One: Meeting Information {#meetinginfo}

At a minimum, please make sure to provide a day/time/room as well as meeting name, point of contact and meeting description.

***Note this is not the room reservation. The actual room reservation happens in the tables in Step 2!***
 
Please sort the meeting by time if possible.
