## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of  [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule)
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org is used for Hackathon presentations and contains repositories for some Hackathon projects.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
    * IETF Hackathon teams should upload their Hackathon project presentations to [GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf118-project-presentations).
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, see details in the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf118-project-presentations/blob/main/README.md)
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before Hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}
  
## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for those who are new to the IETF or new to the Hackathon. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. *. *If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a * at the end of your project name.*

### BIER plugfest
- **Champion(s)**
  - mc36 (remote) freertr.org with a programmable asic up to 12tbps in pizzabox
  - Jeffrey Zhaohui Zhang (on-site) juniper.net with a ptx10k up to 28tbps in a pizzaboz
- **Project Info**
  - its a plugfest, so its normal that we have different targets....
  - freertr.org interested in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-bier-pim-signaling-12 , here is a pre-recorded demo https://files.fm/f/2eanhgkmx 
  - juniper.net interested in mvpn-next services but i let them do their homework... :)
  - the plugfest's goal is packet transport over isis and/or ospf in the simplest topologies possible...

### SCION open source applications
- **Champion(s)**
  - Matthias Frei (matzf at scion.org)
  - Dominik Roos (roos at anapaya.net)
  - Thorben Krüger (thorben.krueger at ovgu.de)
  - François Wirz		(wirzf at inf.ethz.ch)

- **Project Info**
  - Projects centered on open-source SCION applications (Dominik Roos)
    - **HTTP3-over-SCION Plugin for Caddy**
      Create an HTTP3-over-SCION plugin for Caddy, the popular web server.
      This plugin will enable Caddy to seamlessly act as a reverse proxy
      for legacy HTTP servers, unlocking SCION adoption without the need
      for extensive code modifications on existing applications.
      Foundations have been established in [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5573),
      simplifying integration with custom SCION-based networks.
    - **Integrating SVC resolution in QUIC handshake**
      Optimize the SCION control plane RPCs by integrating the SVC
      resolution into the QUIC handshake. This will reduce the number
      of round trips required for the RPCs. Our [open proposal](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/issues/4388) aims to
      eliminate this round trip, simplifying the entire exchange process.
    - **QUIC-Based VPN over SCION**
      Prototype a VPN solution over SCION utilizing QUIC, eliminating the
      need for a SCION-IP Gateway as an intermediary. Building on our
      existing QUIC-over-SCION support, this prototype aims to connect
      hosts seamlessly. We can draw inspiration from [quincy](https://github.com/M0dEx/quincy) for this prototype.
    - **Connect over SCION**
      Enable [Connect](https://connectrpc.com/), an HTTP-based RPC
      framework, to operate over SCION. Unlike gRPC, [connect-go](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-go)
      features a compact codebase primarily built on the Go stdlib,
      simplifying the implementation process.

### SCION Deployment guide
- **SCION Deployment guide**
- **Champion(s)**
  - John Studarus		(John.Studarus at martincoit.net)  
  - Nicola Rustignoli (nic at scion.org)
  - Corine de Kater (cdk at scion.org)
  
- **Project info**

   Part of having a successful open source implementation is making it easy for newcomers (developers, hobbyists, students, etc) to set up and run a SCION environment. [SCIONLab](https://docs.scionlab.org) and the SCION development (scion.sh) are two starting points but going to the “next level” - a stand alone network, can be daunting. This came about when attempting to perform large scale testing of SCION which would have been inappropriate across SCIONLab and unfeasible in a local development environment. 
  Goals:
   - Documentation written up and placed as part of the existing [SCION Docs webpage](https://docs.scion.org/en/latest/)
  - Deployment options (bare metal, VMs, containers)
  - Requirements (hardware and network)
  - Prerequisites - OS version/configuration, network interface configuration
  - Sample deployment architecture(s)/Topologies
  - Where to find packages/binaries (i.e. tagged/tested releases)
  - Creating configuration files
  - Setting up keys (and on-going key operations)
  - Verifying Proper Operations/Troubleshooting guide
  - Prometheus monitoring of SCION metrics


### *D*oes *N*ot *S*cale: Rethinking DNS for the Future of the Internet
- **Champion(s)**
  - Petr Špaček (pspacek at isc.org)
- **Project Info**
  Brainstorming session with people who work on Domain Name System protocol, write implementations and operate networks. How do we make DNS:
    - ... transfers [scale to millions of zones](https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/47/contributions/1017/)? And how do we monitor it?
    - ... protocol & transport handle [humongous post-quantum crypto keys and signatures](https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/46/contributions/985/)?
    - ... support distributed multi-master setups?
    - ... extensible to new wire format & at the same time, **maintain a single namespace**?
    - ... simpler to operate? What if we [rethink basic assumptions](https://icann.zoom.us/rec/share/PUZu_QsO_rdY0gavMatzFOSVpZY1oNahNYnPBuy6pgTUJARw-YIOEzWEV11aqaHW.4Cwr3dGRlunUwhD9?startTime=1693897245000)? (see the talk starting at 33:40)

- **Project Info**
Purpose is to make use of PQ in real world X.509 structures like keys, signatures, certificates and protocols. This will allow us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage in the real world.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md
  
  
  ### PQ Encrypted Client Hello 
- **Champion(s)**
  - Georgios Tasopoulos (g.tasop@isi.gr)
  - Evangelos Haleplidis (haleplidis@isi.gr)
  - Apostolos Fournaris (fournaris@isi.gr)
- **Project Info**
  - Our goal is to initiate an effort to introduce Post-Quantum algorithms (specifically PQ KEMs) into the TLS 1.3 extension Encrypted Client Hello (ECH). We have selected the wolfSSL library as our TLS 1.3 implementation as it includes an ECH extension implementation and we are the most familiar with. We have setup a common code starting point using Vagrant and a github repository in order to help the development between participants during the Hackathon.

### Are long-lived TCP sessions a problem for (DNS) statistics?
- **Champion(s)**
  - Jerry Lundström (jerry at dns-oarc.net) (remote)
  - Roy Arends (roy at dnss.ec)
- **Project Info**
  - Some tools uses packet capturing to do statistics for DNS and some of them needs to see the beginning of the TCP sessions. If resolver systems out there start keeping TCP session against authorities open for a very long time (days or weeks) then it might become a problem for these tools.

    We would like to look at two things;
    1) First to poke at data to see if there are very long-lived TCP sessions out there today, or not(!) which is equally interesting to know.
    2) Second to survey DNS statistics tools out there to see how they handle long-lived TCP sessions to understand how wide a problem this might be, if any. And maybe fix some of them if issues are spotted when doing this.

    Sounds interesting? Do you have data to poke at? Hope to see you at the hackathon then! :)
    
  - Please join [#IETF Hackathon LLTCP](https://chat.dns-oarc.net/community/channels/ietf118-hackathon-lltcp) (on DNS-OARC's Mattermost) to discuss the project with all participants.
    
### Media over QUIC (MoQ)

- **Champion**
  - Suhas Nandakumar
  
- **Project Info**
   - Media over QUIC is developing a low-latency media delivery solution suitable for ingest and distribution of media with for support for relays.This effort is expected to be focused on testing the MoQ transport, using the latest version of draft-ietf-moq-transport as an implementation target.
 - **Documents**

### Tie Die IoT Onboarding and Application Layer Gateway
- **Champions**
   - Eliot Lear ( lear at lear.ch )
   - Bart Brinckman ( bbrinckm at cisco.com )
   - Rohit Mohan ( rohitmo at cisco.com )
- **Project Info**
   - Tie Die is a combination of IoT provisioning technology and an application layer gateway that may be used to register new IoT devices, whether they are BLE, Zigbee, or IP-based. Tie Die starts with the SCIM model for provisioning, with the notion that schemas should be technology neutral. The first code we have, though, is primarily BLE. By the time of the Hackathon we will have Zigbee. We hope also to do some work to enable both DPP, and to extend the SCIM device model to also handle Fido Device Onboarding.

### Low-Latency, Low-Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and Accurate ECN Interop
- **Champion(s)**
  - Greg White (g.white at cablelabs.com)
- **Project Info**
  - L4S and AccECN enable applications to receive fine-grained feedback from the network that allows them to achieve full link utilization, ultra-low latency, ultra-low latency variation, and near-zero packet loss. 
  - This Interop Event will bring together different congestion control implementations and different network implementations of L4S to test RFC/draft compliance, interoperability, and performance in various conditions.
  - As has been the case at several previous IETFs, the intent is to begin work during the Hackathon, and then continue in the Code Lounge for the rest of the week.

### MADINAS - Wi-Fi OpenRoaming
- **Champion(s)**
  - Bruno Tomas (bruno at wballiance.com)
  - Mark Grayson (mgrayson at cisco.com)
- **Project Info**
  - OpenRoaming works similarly to Eduroam, allowing users to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks, but with a federated structure that allows multiple Access Network Providers (ANPs) and multiple Identity Providers (IDPs) to interoperate under the same federation. It leverages technologies developed in the IETF, IEEE802 and Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA), such as RADIUS/RADSEC/PKI (RFCs 2865, 3579, 4372, 5280, 6614…), IEEE 802.1X, 802.11, and WFA WPA2/WPA3. OpenRoaming is being discussed as a solution to some of the use cases considered by the IETF MADINAS WG. The project will look for potential areas of improvement to IETF protocols, as well as potential leakage of PIIs.
  
NOTE1: Hackathon participants wanting to be issued a test certificate for use in mutual authenticated OpenRoaming signalling exchanges, should email pki@wballiance.com with the subject “IETF Hackathon Test Certificate Request”.

NOTE2: The OpenRoaming PKI Certificate Policy and WBA issuing I-CA require specific subject distinguished name values. An example certificate signing request configuration that meets the OpenRoaming Certificate Policy is available here (https://github.com/wireless-broadband-alliance/openroaming-config/blob/main/OpenRoaming%20CSR%20config.cfg)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-foglar-ipv6-ull-routing/ 
an experimental network has been created in Germany with the prefix AF49/16.
The "6Tree" network is ideal vor IoT thanks to
	- IPv6 with phone number prefix and MAC address mapping
	- Intrinsic security thanks to verified IPv6 prefix
  - no DNS for lower access latency
  - low latency thanks to hierarchical network structure
	- Participants are invited to test and evaluate the 6Tree network, for example latency.
Instant access to this network is possible with a PC and a mobile phone with German telephone number. A phone call is used for prefix verification. For non-German residents pre-paid SIM cards will be provided. Technology hand-over to Polish operator planned at the Hackathon.

### Collective Communication Optimizations(CCO)
- **Champion(s)**

  - Wenfei Wu(wenfeiwu@pku.edu.cn)
  - Hongyi Huang(hongyi.huang@huawei.com)
  - Dirk KUTSCHER(ietf@dkutscher.net)
- **Project Info**
  - Collective communication plays a key role in high performance computing and the modern distributed AI training workloads such as recommender systems and natural language processing. It involves a group or groups of processes participating in collective operations like AllReduce or Bcast. The communication model can be one-to-all, all-to-one or all-to-all, but is usually realized by a sequence of unicast messages in underlying network. 
  - Designing network assissted collective communication, that is to offload some collective opeartions to the network to execute one or some key steps in the process, so as to provide more efficient group communication, is drawing some special attentions as the ways for collective communication optimizations (CCO). It also imposes some challenges and requirements for both message transport and packet forwarding, and co-design of protocols and distributed learning frameworks.

### Revision Label in YANG tooling
- **Champions**
  - Per Andersson <perander@cisco.com>
  
- **Project Info**
  - draft-ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning defines the revision-label extension, this change also also updates the specified filename schema for YANG modules (currently **module.yang** or **module@YYYY-MM-DD.yang**) to also support **module#revision-label.yang**.
  - Currently there are ongoing discussions about this change, if it should be or not. One question raised was that it could require a big effort to update tooling to understand the assumed filenames for a YANG module.
  - During this hackathon we explore if changing the assumptions on filenames, and other revision label extensions, for YANG modules requires a big effort.

### Resumable Uploads for HTTP (RUFH)*

This project is beginner-friendly and we encourage all newcomers (and experienced) 
visitors to join from the kickoff or at any time during day.

- **Champions**
  - Marius Kleidl (marius@transloadit.com)
  - Merlijn Vos (merlijn@transloadit.com)
  - Jonathan Flat (jflat@apple.com)
  
- **Project info**
  - HTTP provides resumable downloads out of the box, but not resumable uploads. To handle unreliable networks, many platforms implement their own proprietary approach for resumable uploads. With RUFH, we attempt to find a standard method for resumable uploads allowing interoperable implementions and widespread use.
  - We have a hackathon repository for this project with extra context and requirements: https://github.com/tus/ietf-hackathon
    
- **Specifications**
  - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-upload/02/

- **Challenges**
  - **Resumability polyfill for the Fetch API in browsers**. Creating a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) for the [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API for resumable uploads in the browser. It could help to find a suitable API for resumable upload in browsers.
  - **Plugins for popular HTTP proxies for handling resumable uploads**. Plugins for popular HTTP proxies, which handle resumability with buffering. Once the upload is complete, it will forward the upload as a regular HTTP request to your backend.
  - **CLI program to test if a server conforms to the spec**. Implementing RUFH means re-implementing the same kind of end-to-end tests over and over again. To ensure compatability and interoperability between servers and clients, a tool for checking conformness to the protocol is helpful.
  - **JavaScript runtime compatibility**. There is a rise in JavaScript runtimes, such as Deno, Bun, Cloudfare Workers, AWS Lambda, and more. These should have minimal differences, but the devil is in the details and we need to know if the current version of RUFH works in most runtimes, particularly on the edge. This would be done with a minimal proof of concept of RUFH in JavaScript with different adapters for runtimes.

### Ultra-Low Latency Cryptography

In order to work properly on an IPv6-only network a [CLAT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6877#section-2) is typically needed to help with corner cases like using IPv4-only applications or IPv4 literals. This is especially useful with the advent of [IPv6-mostly](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8925.html#name-terminology) networks where a host can opt-out from IPv4 using *IPv6-Only Preferred* DHCP option. Support for this option is already implemented in Linux DHCPv4 clients ([systemd-networkd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/29472), [dhcpcd](https://github.com/NetworkConfiguration/dhcpcd/commit/25e2eec83b600968f01f7fdb3ebfc3c82fc8c742)) but a properly integrated CLAT is still missing.
Let's try to figure out if anything can be done in this area. For instance a daemon similar to `rdnssd` that would look for [PREF64](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8781) option in router advertisments and set up some NAT46 translator when such option is received.

### Additional Addresses for QUIC

  - The QUIC protocol specifies two techniques for network path migration: Client Migration and Server Preferred Address. The first enables the client to use another local address while the other indicates a server preferred address to be used shortly after the handshake. However, the server cannot advertise additional addresses that a client may use. We proposed an extension consisting of a frame indicating the server's additional addresses in the I-D [draft-piraux-quic-additional-addresses](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-piraux-quic-additional-addresses/).
  - During the hackathon, we will implement the specified extension in open-source QUIC implementations and perform interop testing. We're aiming at testing both QUIC and MPQUIC.
  - Coordination will happen on channel #additional-addresses of the quicdev Slack.
