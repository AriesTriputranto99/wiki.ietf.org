## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of  [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule)
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org is used for Hackathon presentations and contains repositories for some Hackathon projects.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
    * IETF Hackathon teams should upload their Hackathon project presentations to [GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf118-project-presentations).
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, see details in the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf118-project-presentations/blob/main/README.md)
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before Hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}
  
## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

### Are long-lived TCP sessions a problem for (DNS) statistics?
- **Champion(s)**
  - Jerry Lundström (jerry at dns-oarc.net)
  - Roy Arends (roy at dnss.ec)
- **Project Info**
  - Some tools uses packet capturing to do statistics for DNS and some of them needs to see the beginning of the TCP sessions. If resolver systems out there start keeping TCP session against authorities open for a very long time (days or weeks) then it might become a problem for these tools.

    We would like to look at two things;
    1) First to poke at data to see if there are very long-lived TCP sessions out there today, or not(!) which is equally interesting to know.
    2) Second to survey DNS statistics tools out there to see how they handle long-lived TCP sessions to understand how wide a problem this might be, if any. And maybe fix some of them if issues are spotted when doing this.

    Sounds interesting? Do you have data to poke at? Hope to see you at the hackathon then! :)
    
### Media over QUIC (MoQ)

- **Champion**
  - Suhas Nandakumar
  
- **Project Info**
   - Media over QUIC is developing a low-latency media delivery solution suitable for ingest and distribution of media with for support for relays.This effort is expected to be focused on testing the MoQ transport, using the latest version of draft-ietf-moq-transport as an implementation target.

### Tie Die IoT Onboarding and Application Layer Gateway
- **Champions**
   - Eliot Lear ( lear at lear.ch )
   - Bart Brinckman ( bbrinckm at cisco.com )
   - Rohit Mohan ( rohitmo at cisco.com )
- **Project Info**
   - Tie Die is a combination of IoT provisioning technology and an application layer gateway that may be used to register new IoT devices, whether they are BLE, Zigbee, or IP-based. Tie Die starts with the SCIM model for provisioning, with the notion that schemas should be technology neutral. The first code we have, though, is primarily BLE. By the time of the Hackathon we will have Zigbee. We hope also to do some work to enable both DPP, and to extend the SCIM device model to also handle Fido Device Onboarding.

### Low-Latency, Low-Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and Accurate ECN Interop
- **Champion(s)**
  - Greg White (g.white at cablelabs.com)
- **Project Info**
  - L4S and AccECN enable applications to receive fine-grained feedback from the network that allows them to achieve full link utilization, ultra-low latency, ultra-low latency variation, and near-zero packet loss. 
  - This Interop Event will bring together different congestion control implementations and different network implementations of L4S to test RFC/draft compliance, interoperability, and performance in various conditions.
  - As has been the case at several previous IETFs, the intent is to begin work during the Hackathon, and then continue in the Code Lounge for the rest of the week.

### MADINAS - Wi-Fi OpenRoaming
- **Champion(s)**
  - Bruno Tomas (bruno at wballiance.com)
  - Mark Grayson (mgrayson at cisco.com)
- **Project Info**
  - OpenRoaming works similarly to Eduroam, allowing users to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks, but with a federated structure that allows multiple Access Network Providers (ANPs) and multiple Identity Providers (IDPs) to interoperate under the same federation. It leverages technologies developed in the IETF, IEEE802 and Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA), such as RADIUS/RADSEC/PKI (RFCs 2865, 3579, 4372, 5280, 6614…), IEEE 802.1X, 802.11, and WFA WPA2/WPA3. OpenRoaming is being discussed as a solution to some of the use cases considered by the IETF MADINAS WG. The project will look for potential areas of improvement to IETF protocols, as well as potential leakage of PIIs.
  
NOTE1: Hackathon participants wanting to be issued a test certificate for use in mutual authenticated OpenRoaming signalling exchanges, should email pki@wballiance.com with the subject “IETF Hackathon Test Certificate Request”.

NOTE2: The OpenRoaming PKI Certificate Policy and WBA issuing I-CA require specific subject distinguished name values. An example certificate signing request configuration that meets the OpenRoaming Certificate Policy is available here (https://github.com/wireless-broadband-alliance/openroaming-config/blob/main/OpenRoaming%20CSR%20config.cfg)

### A Rust API for DNS
- **Champion**
  - Philip Homburg (philip at nlnetlabs.nl)
- **Project Info**
  - APIs are often specified in C (for example, the socket interface, getaddrinfo, getdns) and then bindings are created for other languages. Rust is both a low level language and sufficiently different from C that it makes sense to take a new look at an API for DNS.
  
### Ad-hoc IoT Networking
- **Champions**
  - Andreas Foglar (foglar@innoroute.com)
  - Marian Ulbricht (ulbricht@innoroute.de)
- **Project Info**
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-foglar-ipv6-ull-routing/ 
an experimental network has been created in Germany with the prefix AF49/16.
The "6Tree" network is ideal vor IoT thanks to
	- IPv6 with phone number prefix and MAC address mapping
	- Intrinsic security thanks to verified IPv6 prefix
  - no DNS for lower access latency
  - low latency thanks to hierarchical network structure
	- Participants are invited to test and evaluate the 6Tree network, for example latency.
Instant access to this network is possible with a PC and a mobile phone with German telephone number. A phone call is used for prefix verification. For non-German residents pre-paid SIM cards will be provided. Technology hand-over to Polish operator planned at the Hackathon.

  ### High-level CoAP abstraction in RIOT
- **Champions**
  - Tim Rieß tim.riess@mailbox.tu-dresden.de
  - Jan Sommer jan.sommer@mailbox.tu-dresden.de
  - Dennis Kraus dennis.kraus@mailbox.tu-dresden.de
  - Niko Kirste niko.kirste@mailbox.tu-dresden.de
- **Project Info**
  - There are many diverging implementations for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP, RFC 7252)
  - We try to implement a prototype for a high-level API for the RIOT operating system that can be used on top of different CoAP implementations.


### Dynamic Network Routing
- **Champion(s)**
  - Greg White (g.white at cablelabs.com)
- **Project Info**
  - L4S and AccECN enable applications to receive fine-grained feedback from the network that allows them to achieve full link utilization, ultra-low latency, ultra-low latency variation, and near-zero packet loss. 
  - This Interop Event will bring together different congestion control implementations and different network implementations of L4S to test RFC/draft compliance, interoperability, and performance in various conditions.
  - As has been the case at several previous IETFs, the intent is to begin work during the Hackathon, and then continue in the Code Lounge for the rest of the week.
