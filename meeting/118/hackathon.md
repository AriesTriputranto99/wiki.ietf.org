## Meeting Materials

* Code can be accessed from  [IETF Hackathon GitHub](https://github.com/ietf-hackathon), or from links provided within project descriptions below.
    * Request to be added to IETF GitHub organization by sending your GitHub ID to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org).
* Results of Hackathon projects should be uploaded to [GitHub]. See the [README] for details.

## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of  [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule)
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org is used for Hackathon presentations and contains repositories for some Hackathon projects.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
    * IETF Hackathon teams should upload their Hackathon project presentations to [GitHub].
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, see details in the [README]
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before Hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}
  
## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

- **Project Info**
Purpose is to make use of PQ in real world X.509 structures like keys, signatures, certificates and protocols. This will allow us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage in the real world.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

  - Evangelos Haleplidis (haleplidis@isi.gr)
  - Apostolos Fournaris (fournaris@isi.gr)
- **Project Info**
  - Our goal is to initiate an effort to introduce Post-Quantum algorithms (specifically PQ KEMs) into the TLS 1.3 extension Encrypted Client Hello (ECH). We have selected the wolfSSL library as our TLS 1.3 implementation as it includes an ECH extension implementation and we are the most familiar with. We have setup a common code starting point using Vagrant and a github repository in order to help the development between participants during the Hackathon.

### Tapsce, TAPS in space
- **Champion(s)**
  - Emile Stephan (emile.stephan@orange.com)
  - Marc Blanchet (marc.blanchet@viagenie.ca)
- **Project Info**
  - The purpose of the project is to devellop an open-source TAPS transport service for space an deep space based on existing open source QUIC stack and extensions. 
    
  - This includes prior knowledge parameters already discussed during at Marc table during IETF117 hackathon : need to customize the bootstrapping parameters, default parameters, multipath...
 
  - When needed, the project will extend TAPS API for covering DTN transport services like store-and-forward, routing, dynamic network paths...;
 
  - To ease the work during this first table it is suggested to start with Christian [QUIC to Mars]( https://www.privateoctopus.com/2023/02/07/quic-to-mars.html) open-source QUIC implementation.

### Are long-lived TCP sessions a problem for (DNS) statistics?
- **Champion(s)**
  - Jerry Lundström (jerry at dns-oarc.net)
  - Roy Arends (roy at dnss.ec)
- **Project Info**
  - Some tools uses packet capturing to do statistics for DNS and some of them needs to see the beginning of the TCP sessions. If resolver systems out there start keeping TCP session against authorities open for a very long time (days or weeks) then it might become a problem for these tools.

    We would like to look at two things;
    1) First to poke at data to see if there are very long-lived TCP sessions out there today, or not(!) which is equally interesting to know.
    2) Second to survey DNS statistics tools out there to see how they handle long-lived TCP sessions to understand how wide a problem this might be, if any. And maybe fix some of them if issues are spotted when doing this.

    Sounds interesting? Do you have data to poke at? Hope to see you at the hackathon then! :)
    
### Tie Die IoT Onboarding and Application Layer Gateway
- **Champions**
   - Eliot Lear ( lear at lear.ch )
   - Bart Brinckman ( bbrinckm at cisco.com )
   - Rohit Mohan ( rohitmo at cisco.com )
- **Project Info**
   - Tie Die is a combination of IoT provisioning technology and an application layer gateway that may be used to register new IoT devices, whether they are BLE, Zigbee, or IP-based. Tie Die starts with the SCIM model for provisioning, with the notion that schemas should be technology neutral. The first code we have, though, is primarily BLE. By the time of the Hackathon we will have Zigbee. We hope also to do some work to enable both DPP, and to extend the SCIM device model to also handle Fido Device Onboarding.
- **Documents**
  - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-scim-device-model
  - Draft for Non-IP-Control (NIPC) to be released shortly, along with open source.

### Low-Latency, Low-Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and Accurate ECN Interop
- **Champion(s)**
  - Greg White (g.white at cablelabs.com)
- **Project Info**
  - L4S and AccECN enable applications to receive fine-grained feedback from the network that allows them to achieve full link utilization, ultra-low latency, ultra-low latency variation, and near-zero packet loss. 
  - This Interop Event will bring together different congestion control implementations and different network implementations of L4S to test RFC/draft compliance, interoperability, and performance in various conditions.
  - As has been the case at several previous IETFs, the intent is to begin work during the Hackathon, and then continue in the Code Lounge for the rest of the week.
- **Documents**
  - [RFC9330](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9330.html)
