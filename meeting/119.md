## Brisbane Travel Options
### Bus, Ferry and Trains in Brisbane and South East Queensland

South East Queensland has a single integrated ticketing system for all forms of public transport *bus, train, ferry: not hire-car, taxi or uber*, which [covers the region](https://translink.widen.net/s/5wfnjq8tkx/230109-seq-fare-zone) -including Brisbane, North to Noosa and south to Coolangatta.

Most forms of public transport included in this system will require use of a [Go Card](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card) which can be obtained from railway stations with a ticket office, or a [range of retailers](https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/go-card/locations). Travel requires check-on and check-off, with transfer between bus, train and ferry possible within a time limit.

Some buses accept cash, but others are go-card only. Bus boarding is by any entrance unless otherwise indicated. Buses typically require flagging down to stop. 

High speed ["citycat" and cross river "kittycat"](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services) ferries are included in this ticketing system. Ferries operate [between U.Q St Lucia and Northshore Hamilton](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services/citycat-and-ferry-terminal-locations) with multiple stops in the city.

### Bike and Scooter hire

Brisbane permits use of e-bikes and scooters, with both [Neuron](https://www.rideneuron.com/) and [Beam](https://www.ridebeam.com/au) available. Use of these bikes and scooters is covered by the [BCC and Queensland Road Rules](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/outdoor-activities/riding-in-brisbane/cycling-rules-signs-and-safety-tips) and require use of a helmet which should be provided with the device. Scooters and Bikes can be speed limited by geofencing in some locations. 

## Food and drink in the IETF meeting area

The IETF119 venue is close to a wide array of food and drink choices. The [Southbank parklands](https://eatsouthbank.com.au/eat-and-drink/) has a good guide to choices in the immediate area. These include riverside eating, as well as [Little Stanley Street](https://eatsouthbank.com.au/dining-guide/?precincts=little-stanley-street) close to the meeting Hotel.

### Tipping culture: "it depends"

Australia has one of the worlds best [Minimum Wage](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/tools-and-resources/fact-sheets/minimum-workplace-entitlements/minimum-wages) award systems and all food and drink service staff are paid at or above this level.  Weekend and public holiday work can earn a supplement and may therefore have a noted extra charge.

Tipping is not mandatory, and does not form part of the normal renumeration for serving or cooking staff. Tipping counter staff at shops is highly unusual. 

For exceptional service in a restaurant or cafe it is not unusual to tip. Increasing use of paywave methods includes the proffer of a tip at 10%, 15% or 20% but this can be (and very frequently is) skipped. If you see a tip jar its a signal cash tipping is preferred, but this is entirely voluntary and you won't be chased out of the place if you ignore it: a lot of the time for card payment the service staff will click through the tip screens anyway.

High end venues or large group venue bookings may assume or require a tip.
