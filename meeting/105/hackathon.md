-------
##  Participant Preparation and Prerequisites

* Choosing a Project
   * Champions will have table signs on the center of their table identifying their project and be available to answer questions at the start and throughout the hackathon
   * Optionally, champions may create and display posters on flip charts with additional information on their project
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in this wiki in the "Projects Included in Hackathon" section
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
* Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs
   * Installing and becoming familiar with VirtualBox, Vagrant, or something similar will help
   * Note to champions: if planning to make use of VMs, please bring on USB drives to make available to others as download times can be painful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose
* Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * [IETF Hackathon GitHub Org](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon)
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com
* Training Materials
   * Network programmability based on IETF standard protocols and models is relevant to many projects. Self paced online training modules are available on Cisco !DevNet. Access is free but a !DevNet account is required. You can login or create an account quickly with this IETF Hackathon specific link [https://developer.cisco.com/join/ietf105 IETF 105 Hackathon]
      * [Intro to Coding Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/fundamentals)
      * [REST API Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/rest-api-fundamentals)
      * [Introduction to Model Driven Programmability (YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF)](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)

   * Champions for each technology are encouraged to share any other things they think would be helpful in preparation for the hackathon
* Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did on Sunday afternoon at the end of the hackathon
    * [https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf105-project-presentations] is for IETF hackathon participants to upload their hackathon project presentations
    * You must be a member of the [https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon IETF-Hackathon] GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@ cisco.com your GitHub ID at your earliest convenience
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos


## Network and Power
* Network
   * Wireless access to the IETF network will be provided, and from there to the outside world
   * The IETF network will be dual stack with both IPv6 and IPv4
   * Wired access to the IETF network is available by request only
   * For wired access, static IP addresses, or any other special network requests, please add your name, email address, and details of your request in the **Requests** section below.
* Power
   * There will be two power strips per table (roughly one outlet per person/seat). If you need additional power for your project/team, please add your name, email address, and details of your request in the **Requests** section below.
* Requests
   * Michael Richardson, mcr@sandelman.ca, need 3 power outlets, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation and routing of delegated prefixes. Homenet, MUD and ACP areas will each need that.

   * Bob Hinden bob.hinden@gmail.com, Wired ethernet and small switch for 6MAN, Path MTU Discovery project.

## Remote participation

Participating in person is preferred, but we understand not everyone can travel. We typically have a number of remote participants and even some projects that are championed remotely. Successful remote participation requires a bit more preparation by remote participants and champions of projects with remote participants. 

In addition to [registering](https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf105/hackathonregistration.py) for the hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the hackathon list, it is recommended to monitor both the hackathon wiki and the list as the hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

The hackathon kickoff and the closing presentations are available via Meetecho. The hackathon Jabber room may be used for general and project specific communication.
* Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org
* Meetecho: http://ietf105.conf.meetecho.com/

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

**WebRTC 1.0 Improvements and testing**

The goal is to get around the table for two days browser devs, SFU devs, and webrtc solutions devs in general to help mature WebRTC 1.0.
The feedback between browsers and solutions/SFU/SDK vendors is very important to make sure the bugs are prioritised correctly to benefit the ecosystem.
Specifically for simulcast (or SVC) questions about bandwidth management, bitrate adaptation, PLI generation, FEC, needs to be addressed jointly by both 
SFU devs and Browsers devs.
The results of the week end should be new bug discovery, bugs closure, and new tests written to avoid regression. We should all leave with a better
implementation, be it browser, SFU, SDk, .... and a more interoperable ecosystem. Last edition, we managed to solve around 20 bugs.
Contact one of the champion if you have a specific problem / tech / bug you want to work on during the week end, and want to join the table to benefit from
interaction with other experts.

**DNSSD (Bonjour) clinic**
 * Champions:
    * Ted Lemon (mellon at fugue.com)
    * Stuart Cheshire (cheshire at apple.com)
  * Project:
     * If your Hackathon project provides a network service and would like to be able to advertise it:
        * stop by the DNSSD table
        * we’ll help you to figure out whether DNSSD is a good solution for your use case
        * if it is, we'll help you to learn how to use it (it's really easy!)
     * Similarly, if your project needs to be able to discover services, we can help you with that too
     * We are of course happy to help you with non-hackathon projects as well!
     * It's very easy to set up, so if you are interested in trying, it's quite reasonable to expect that you will have something running fairly quickly.
     * We did this informally at the previous hackathon, but have decided to offer it explicitly at this one.

         * and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc/
       * At this Hackathon, in order to save precious time, we will not focus on live LPWAN connectivity. Instead, we will exchange SCHC messages inside the simulation environment or over UDP, allowing easy remote participation including remote testing between participants.
       * The actions points for this week-end:
         * converge on rule representations, code
         * improve the documentation. In general, make it easier for a newcomer to join the project and contribute.

         * The [http://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk ILNP_project] is enhancing the Internet Architecture by enriching the set of namespaces. The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an Address and replace it with separate Locator and Identifier values. Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our research demonstration will be based on IPv6.
