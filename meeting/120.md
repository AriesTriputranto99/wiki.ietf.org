## Tipping Culture

The tipping culture in Canada features customary tip amounts for different services. Common tipping practices include tipping restaurants, bars, hotels, taxi services, train assistants, and other personal services. The standard tipping percentage in Canada is 15 to 20 percent for service staff. When tipping, use the local currency for easy calculations and exchange. There's no standard tipping policy in Canada. Most tippers consider factors such as exceptional service, menu prices, and payment options. Tipping practices and amounts also vary depending on the type of establishment.
