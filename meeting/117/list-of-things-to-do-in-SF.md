# Things to do in SF

The following is a list of random things to do in San Francisco, with
some markings for what they are and how touristy they are.  SF is a
wonderful city to walk around, but do be prepared to climb some steep
hills depending on where you go.

# Touristy attractions 

## Fisherman’s Wharf

Touristy fish market

## Pier 39

Touristy shopping pier, lots of small shops selling everything from
kites to fudge to jewelry.

## SF Trolleys

Start at **Powell/Mason Cable Car Turnaround**

Expect to wait in a line if you want to ride it

# Near by

## China town

SF has a well known China Town full of shops and restaurants.  1.5 km walk away.

## Coit tower

A 210 ft tall tower that has stood above the city since its inauguration in 1934. The Art-deco style tower is surrounded by a nearly 5-acre park, Pioneer Park, and offers a 360-degree view of the entire city, the bay, the Golden Gate, and Alcatraz

## Maritime Museum and Ships

**Warning: this looks closed!!!**

If you enjoy old sea-going ships, this is an excellent museum and set
of ships you can walk around.  Wes was once lucky enough to sleep over
night on the Balclutha, a three-masted, steel-hulled, square-rigged
ship built to carry a variety of cargo all over the world.

## USS Pampanito

Have you ever wanted to *Run Silent, Run Deep*? You can tour a WW II US diesel submarine. It's authentic, down to the cramped, smelly quarters. Access is by ladder only.

# Museums

SF has many museums that are worth visiting.  Here are but a few:

## Exploratorum science museum

A very hands-on science museum 

https://www.exploratorium.edu/

## de Young Museum (art)

Fine art.

https://www.famsf.org/

## **Musée Mécanique**

Wes thinks this is one of the best hidden things in SF.  It contains
arcade type history games from the old "shock yourself" games up to
some more modern classics like pac-man and defender.  Located near
fisherman's wharf

## **Museum of 3D Illusions**

Haven’t been here, but it looks very cool for a short visit

## **California Academy of Sciences**

A Natural History museum

We had an IETF social here in the past.

## San Francisco Botanical Gardens

# Landmarks

## **Ferry Building**

1.7km one-way walk.  Not much to see once there, but still a nice walk
to the bay shore.

## Yoda Fountain

Apparently there is a fountain of Yoda outside of the Letterman digital Arts Center

## Lombard Street

Iconic winding street (but only one block of it is winding).  Often
has a line of cars waiting to drive down it.

## **Grace Cathedral**

Two winding labyrinths supposedly (Wes hasn't been there)

# Shopping

## **Ghirardelli Chocolate Experience**

# Farther away and requires planning

## Alcatraz Prison

THE iconic prison.  It will take at least half a day to get there and
back by ferry.

## Marin Headlands

One of Wes' favorite places to hike and see the shoreline

## Old batteries

There are a lot of old army batteries that were responsible for
defending the shoreline years ago.  You can walk around many of them,
but the interiors are generally closed off.  If you want to go, look
on maps near the ocean (the closest are probably south of the golden
gate bridge and there is a nice trail along there).

## Golden Gate Park

A beautiful hiking and walking area around the golden gate.  Contains
many of the batteries discussed above

## Golden Gate Bridge

Obviously a well known landmark.  Lots of people enjoy walking across
the eastern side, or even renting bikes and biking across. 

## Beaches

There are a number of beaches to visit, and the further east you go the bigger the waves get generally.  Ocean beach is a big long strip of beach that is popular but so big there aren't endless people on it.  The other beaches just east of the golden gate facing the bridge can get you good views of the bridge and the bay.

**Warning: the pacific ocean is COLD and also frequently has an undercurrent -- if you want to swim, check the signs first**

## Redwoods

Muir Woods is a very famous but small redwood forest.  It **requires reservations** in advance for parking in particular.  And there is no cell phone signals there so you MUST make them ahead of time and bring them with you.  It's a fairly small park, but does contain big towering trees and if you get out of the main loop in the valley floor you can get a good 4-5 mile hike in if you plan it right.
