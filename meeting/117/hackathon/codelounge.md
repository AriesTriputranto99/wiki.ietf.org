# Code Lounge
Monday - Friday, 24-28 July, Room: TBD

The Code Lounge provides a space for groups to informally meet to brainstorm, code, and test ideas. The area will be designated by signage. 

You are encouraged to look at the final agenda and determine time slots best suited to ensure successful attendance of Code Lounge sessions as well as any traditional working group sessions. **It is okay for multiple groups to sign up for the same time slots. This is in fact encouraged for work that spans multiple working groups.**

Please sign up for a time slot below by entering your working group or Hackathon project acronym.
