# Results Presentation Schedule

Hackathon teams are welcome and encouraged to present their results during the Hackathon Closing - Friday, November 13, 05:00 UTC / 12:00 ICT ([Hackathon agenda](/meeting/109/hackathon#Agenda)). Please add the name of your team and the name of the presenter to the table at the bottom of this page.

All presentations should be uploaded to https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf109-project-presentations. See the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf109-project-presentations/blob/master/README.md) for details.

Presenters will use the screen sharing functionality within Meetecho to drive their own presentations. Please review the [Guide of IETF 109 Participants](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/109/session-participant-guide/) to familiarize yourself with the Meetecho platform and test your setup in advance.

As mentioned during the Hackathon kickoff, results presentations are limited to 5 minutes each. You are welcome to include more information in what you upload to https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf109-project-presentations, but please plan for what you share at the Hackathon closing to fit within the 5 minute time limit.

During the Hackathon Closing, we will run through the presentations in the order listed in the table below.
