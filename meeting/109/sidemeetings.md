# Unofficial Side Meetings at IETF 109

For IETF 109 Online this wiki provides a place where individuals can post details about side meetings. Side meetings posted here should be open for anyone to attend.

Since there are many freely available conferencing services, the IESG will not provide conferencing support for side meetings. Reach out to meetings@ietf.org if this setup presents any difficulties for you.

The [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well) applies to these meetings. Blue sheets are only produced for official WG sessions; side meetings here do not use blue sheets.

This time we will not compile all side meetings into a single calendar. If you would like to create your own .ics file for your meeting, please put the link in the appropriate column.

Please list your meeting in UTC. For help converting time zones, please use a tool like [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html). For reference, IETF WG sessions are scheduled between 05:00 and 11:00 UTC.

## Steps to schedule a side meeting:

 1.   Please choose the day that you want to meet.
 2.   Please select the time that best accommodates your group and complete the table fields. At a minimum, please make sure to provide a meeting name, point of contact and meeting description.
  3.  Please arrange your own conferencing service and put the link in the table.
