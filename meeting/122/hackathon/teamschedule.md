# Team Schedule
The IETF Hackathon is taking place as a hybrid event. The overall agenda for the Hackathon is [HERE](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/meeting/122/hackathon).

Within the overall agenda, it is up to individual project teams to determine their own preferred ways to collaborate. Many teams likely include both in-person and remote participants.

The IETF is using gather.town to facilitate social interaction at the IETF meeting. There is a space for the Hackathon with tables and whiteboards that teams can use for group communication and information sharing. [Gather](https://gather.town/app/L4fNNdm1NJa1sE2v/ietf)  (password: notewell)


You are free to use gather.town, and you may also use Zoom, Webex, Slack, or whatever works best for your team. If you want to use Webex and need a Webex account, you can find more info [HERE](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/meeting/122/hackathon#Webexsessionsforteams).
