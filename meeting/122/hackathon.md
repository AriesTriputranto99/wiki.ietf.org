## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](/meeting/122/hackathon/hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

## <a id="ProjectsIncludedinHackathon"></a>Projects Included in Hackathon

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for those who are new to the IETF or new to the Hackathon. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. *. *If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a * at the end of your project name.*

- **Project Info**
Test interoperability of Post Quantum algorithms in x.509 structures (Certificates, keys, CMS and other drafts).   This project started in November 2022 and continues to evolve.  We currently have some github automated actions to automaticlaly test submitted artifacts allowing implementations to get immedidate feedback on their compatibility. This allows us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

At IETF 122, we plan to add more automation, add interoperability testing for the private key formats (like ML-DSA and ML-KEM), and continue to update our implementations to support the FIPS 203, 204 and 205 algorithm standards.  We are also looking for implementations of Composite Signatures, Composite KEM and other PQ transition mechanisms that are being standardized.    

There is also interest in setup and testing the use of hybrid certificates for the TLSv1.3 protocol. The goal of the experiment is to explore different options for efficient use of hybrid certificates' and their multiple signature keys in the TLS protocol. We are looking for collaborations and ideas that can be then brought forward within the IETF and other standardization bodies (e.g., X9, ISO, etc.).

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk
  - Rodney Grimes rgrimes@freebsd.org
  - Alistair Woodman awoodman@netdef.org

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on realising ILNP on IPv6.

	- The goal of this project is to demonstrate how operators can utilize IETF Topology YANG models to represent a real carrier IP/MPLS network, focusing on:
	- Using the IETF topology model to represent a carrier network based on ISIS and SRV6 domains.
	- Linking topological entities to external models/data.
	- Evaluating whether RFC8345 is a suitable standard for representing multi-layered topologies for SIMap, and comparing models with and without the identified gaps.

- **Hackathon Plan**
	- In IETF121 Hackathon, we demonstrated how RFC8345 could be used to model IS-IS and OSPF in both operator and virtual LAB environments, showcasing how to link topology to external data (such as inventory and metrics data). 
	- The objective for this hackathon is to improve upon that prototype by:
	- Enhancing methods for retrieving configuration attributes and metrics through the RFC8345 API, with IS-IS/OSPF/SRV6 augmentations.
	- Demonstrating use cases such as traversing queries and querying external data for topology entities.

### MAPRG IPv6 Test Pod Open Testing and Diagnosis
- **Champions**
David Plonka dave@plonka.us (MAPRG co-chair, WiscNet's Principal Research Scientist)

- **Project Info**
The Measurement & Analysis for Protocols Research Group ([MAPRG](https://www.irtf.org/maprg.html)) and [WiscNet (AS2381)](https://wiscnet.net/) will provide an open testing environment for participants to determine how well equipment and applications work in a variety of IPv6 network environments.

  To accomplish this, we will provide access to the IPv6 Test Pod (https://ipv6-pod.info/): a wireless and wired access point specially configured for testing IPv6 compatibility and graciously provided by [Internet2](https://internet2.edu/) and the [ARIN Community Grant program](https://www.arin.net/blog/2023/09/11/Congratulations-2023-ARIN-Community-GrantRecipients/#ipv6-test-pod).

  > The IPv6 Test Pod provides a variety of IPv6 test networks via Wifi SSIDs and optionally over Wired Ethernet connections. All you have to do is provide a wired internet connection to the WAN interface (IPv4-only is OK), power, and it will provide a series of networks to test devices and software with:
  >
  > * Dual-Stack (IPv4 and IPv6)
  > * IPv6-only
  > * IPv6 only with NAT64+DNS64
  > * IPv6-only with NAT64+PREF64
  > * IPv6 only with NAT64+DNS64+PREF64

  In addition to employing the IPv6 Test Pod, we'll do complementary testing with IPvFoo browser extension, the IETF network, etc.

- **Open Call for Participants**
  *Anyone* can drop by for ad hoc IPv6-compatibility testing of your wireless or wired user equipment, *e.g.,* smartphone, or application(s) of interest, web-based or otherwise.

  Please join the project, and stay a while, if you are an IPv6 or transition mechanism aficionado, or simply want to learn more about using IPv6 in a live environment. We could use help with testing and identifying the root causes of problems found.

- Background:
  * [IPvFoo browser extension/add-on for Chrome and Firefox](https://github.com/pmarks-net/ipvfoo)

### Enhancing ICMP Error Message Authentication Using Challenge-Confirm Mechanism
- **Champions**
  - Ziqiang Wang ziqiangwang@seu.edu.cn
  - Yuxiang Yang yangyx22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn
  - Ao Wang wangao@seu.edu.cn
- **Project Info**
  The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) plays a crucial role in network diagnostics and error reporting. However, verifying the legitimacy of a received ICMP error message can be challenging, especially when the ICMP error message is embedded with stateless protocol data. In this project, we will demonstrate attacks constructed by exploiting ICMP vulnerabilities and a defense mechanism based on a challenge-confirm mechanism.

### Implemententing Initial HSYNC Processes
- **Champions**
  - Johan Stenstam (johan.stenstam@internetstiftelsen.se)
- **Project Info**
   The proposed HSYNC DNS record allows zone owners to specify exactly what services they intend different DNS providers to 
   provide and how to collaborate. The HSYNC RRset specifies the identity of all designated DNS providers, allowing them to 
   identify and locate each other and establish secure communication. This allows automated collaboration to solve a number of 
   provisioning issues like how to manage the DNSKEY RRset (when there are multiple signers), how to manage the NS RRset (when 
   there are multiple authoritative DNS providers), how to deal with on-boarding and off-boarding of DNS providers and also who 
   is responsible for interaction with the parent (for synchronization of delegation information).

   The experimental name server TDNS has support for HSYNC and the identification and location of remote DNS providers (or 
   rather, their agents). The next steps are to implement support for initial processes:
  - Implement *NOTIFICATION* of remote DNS providers when there is a change to the local DNSKEY RRset (i.e. typically steps in a key rollover)
  - Synchronize the contributions of individual NS records from different DNS providers into a unified NS RRset.

### <a id="Thread"></a>Low-Power Wireless IPv6 Networking with Thread *
- **Champion**
Stuart Cheshire &lt;cheshire@apple.com&gt;

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a [brief presentation about Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s) at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/proceedings#:~:text=iabopen). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/).
For this Hackathon event, the goal is to introduce people to Thread and OpenThread programming. This Hackathon event is open to all — Thread Group membership is not required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate. If you plan to participate in the Thread work at the Hackathon (on-site or remotely), please add your name to the participant list. If you already have a Thread developer board and the OpenThread build environment on your laptop, please bring that. If not, we will have a few extra Thread developer boards available and we can help you get the build environment set up. For people totally new to Thread development, we have some recommendations from [Allie Clifford](/meeting/120/hackathon/Thread-Guide-Allie-Clifford) and [Ann Olivo](/meeting/120/hackathon/Thread-Guide-Ann-Olivo).
We have a list of some project ideas. Other ideas are welcome and encouraged. Please feel free to add suggestions to the project list.

- **Participants and Project Info**
  - To avoid taking up too much space on the main Hackathon page, Thread participants and projects are listed separately on the [Thread Projects page](/meeting/122/hackathon/thread-projects).
