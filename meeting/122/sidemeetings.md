The process to schedule side meetings has changed for IETF 122!

Rather than a self-managed wiki, the Secretariat will now be allocating room spaces for side meetings. 

Please see the [Side Meeting Request Form](https://www.ietf.org/forms/side-meetings/) and the [Side Meetings Schedule](https://trello.com/b/R7yDMPyl) for more details.
