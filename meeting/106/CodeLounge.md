# IETF Code Lounge
Room: [Moor/Morrison](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/106/floor-plan?room=moor-morrison)

At IETF 106 working groups and attendees have the ability to organize sessions focused on running code in an effort to diversify the type of work that happens during IETF meetings. This will allow for groups to informally meet to brainstorm, code, and test ideas in the Code Lounge, a portion of the IETF lounge set aside for such activities. The area will be designated by signage.
You are encouraged to look at the final agenda and determine timeslots best suited to ensure successful attendance of Code Lounge sessions as well as any traditional working group sessions. **It is okay for multiple groups to sign up for the same timeslots. This is in fact encouraged for work that spans multiple WGs.**

Please sign up for a timeslot below by entering your WG or project acronym.
