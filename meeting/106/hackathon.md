- Development Environment
	- Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
	- Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs
	- Installing and becoming familiar with VirtualBox, Vagrant, or something similar will help
	- Note to champions: if planning to make use of VMs, please bring on USB drives to make available to others as download times can be painful
	- Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose
- Sharing Code
	- Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
	- An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
	- [IETF Hackathon GitHub Org](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon)
		- If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com
- Training Materials
	- Network programmability based on IETF standard protocols and models is relevant to many projects. Self paced online training modules are available on Cisco DevNet. Access is free but a DevNet account is required. You can login or create an account quickly with this IETF Hackathon specific link [IETF 106 Hackathon](https://developer.cisco.com/join/ietf106)

- Champions for each technology are encouraged to share any other things they think would be helpful in preparation for the hackathon
- Project Presentations
	- All teams have the opportunity to present what they did on Sunday afternoon at the end of the hackathon
		- https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf106-project-presentations is for IETF hackathon participants to upload their hackathon project presentations
		- You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
		- To be added as a member, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com your GitHub ID at your earliest convenience
		- DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos
### Network and Power
- Network
	- Wireless access to the IETF network will be provided, and from there to the outside world
	- The IETF network will be dual stack with both IPv6 and IPv4
	- Wired access to the IETF network is available by request only
	- For wired access, static IP addresses, or any other special network requests, please add your name, email address, and details of your request in the Requests section below.
- Power
	- There will be two power strips per table (roughly one outlet per person/seat). If you need additional power for your project/team, please add your name, email address, and details of your request in the Requests section below.

### Remote participation
Participating in person is preferred, but we understand not everyone can travel. We typically have a number of remote participants and even some projects that are championed remotely. Successful remote participation requires a bit more preparation by remote participants and champions of projects with remote participants.

In addition to [registering](https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf106/hackathonregistration.py) for the hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the hackathon list, it is recommended to monitor both the hackathon wiki and the list as the hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

The hackathon kickoff and the closing presentations are available via Meetecho. The hackathon Jabber room may be used for general and project specific communication.

- Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org
- Meetecho: http://ietf106.conf.meetecho.com/
### IPR and Code Contribution Guideline
All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

## Projects Included in Hackathon (add your project using the template provided at end of project list)
- Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for first time IETFers and/or first time hackathoners. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. '*'. If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a '*' at the end of your project name.
### Bonjour / DNS-Based Service Discovery / DNSSD Code Clinic

- Champion
	- Stuart Cheshire (cheshire at apple.com)
- Project
	- Service Discovery Code Clinic. If your application has any place where a human user enters a hostname or IP address, come by for hands-on help updating your application to use network service discovery to improve that user experience. We can help you do this using the APIs available on Windows, Android, Linux, macOS, and iOS. If you’re using another platform, we can help you port the open source mDNSResponder code to that platform too. Please email Stuart Cheshire with “Code Clinic” in the subject line to arrange a time slot.

### WebRTC 1.0 Improvements and testing

The goal is to get around the table for two days browser devs, SFU devs, and webrtc solutions devs in general to help mature WebRTC 1.0. The feedback between browsers and solutions/SFU/SDK vendors is very important to make sure the bugs are prioritised correctly to benefit everyone. Specifically for simulcast (or SVC) questions about bandwidth management, bitrate adaptation, PLI generation, FEC, needs to be addressed jointly by both SFU devs and Browsers devs.

The results of the week end should be new bug discovery, bugs closure, and new tests written to avoid regression. We should all leave with a better implementation, be it browser, SFU, SDK, .... and a more interoperable ecosystem.

- [104's Edition](/meeting/104/Hackathon/webrtc), we managed to solve around 20 bugs.
- [105's Edition](/meeting/105/hackathon/webrtc), we managed to solve around XX bugs.
Contact one of the champion if you have a specific problem / tech / bug you want to work on during the week end, and want to join the table to benefit from interaction with other experts.
