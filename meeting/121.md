## Map
The following link is a map of restaurants, attractions, hotels, etc. in the Dublin area surrounding the IETF venue. 
[IETF 121 Map of Dublin](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1vCTNFE8UZgdZSHzUlgzeUzSJfc-HZV8&ll=53.38050498751454%2C-6.1889417999999985&z=12)

Generally Dublin city is relatively safe, but it's a city so nornal rules apply. In terms of the location, mostly you'll find better things south of the river from the convention centre. The area around Grafton Street (+/- 0.5km or so) has plenty of bars and restaurants and is generally the direction to head in the evenings. The grand canal basin, almost directly over the river from the convention centre has some shops/bars/restaurants and is a reasonable place to head if the weather's ok. The couple of blocks north of the convention centre also have some shops and a few restaurants.

If you want to join many other tourists then goto temple bar. It's not terrible but there are better places.

### Dublin Express :bus:
The Dublin Express operates premium quality coaches between Dublin Airport and their 15+ conveniently located stops across the heart of Dublin City Centre. Buses operate between 03:05 and 00:35. Journey time will depend on traffic conditions etc. but is usually 30 minutes from the city centre.

Dublin Express operates from Zone 1 at Terminal 1 and Zone 21 at Terminal 2 and travels directly into Dublin via the Port Tunnel, making it the fastest coach to Dublin City Centre.
*It is recommended to pre-book tickets.*

## Transportation

Dublin can be easily navigated by bus, train, and the tram system Luas. Walking and renting bikes are also efficient ways of getting around the city.

- [Bus](https://www.dublinpublictransport.ie/dublin-buses)
- [Train](https://www.dublinpublictransport.ie/dublin-trains) 
- [Luas](https://www.dublinpublictransport.ie/dublin-trams)
- Taxi or Uber
- [Bicycle](https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home)
- Car Rental

[More information on getting around Dublin](https://www.visitdublin.com/plan/getting-around)

For bus, train and trams, you can use the [LEAP card](https://about.leapcard.ie/leap-visitor-card). You cannot use your debit/credit card to pay on busses, trains or trams. A basic bus trip (which is most all of 'em) is €2. You tap your card on entering the bus from the front door. For trams and trains you "tap on and tap off" on the platform. You can add credit to leap cards in many newsagents or using machines at train stations or tram stops or from your phone if you install their app and have NFC etc. I don't believe the leap card can be used on the airport coaches, though there are (slower) Dublin Bus services between the airport and the city where leap cards do work if you prefer that.

## Tipping Culture

It's normal to tip in some situations in Ireland, but not obligatory.

[Tipping in Ireland](https://www.tripsavvy.com/tipping-in-ireland-1542784)

Tipping ~10% for table service in restaurants and cafes is customary if they didn't already include a service charge. The bill will say if a service charge is included - usually it isn't for fewer than 6 people. Tipping in bars (if you don't eat) and for over-the-counter food purchase is optional and not that common for locals. Tip jars are common, but discretionary.

A taxi driver will never decline a tip.

## The Folk Music Scene

Sessions in Dublin are listed at [The Session](https://thesession.org/sessions/search?day=&q=Dublin%2C+Ireland) -which is sometimes old information. Etiquette for joining in a session varies, some places welcome absolute beginners, many demand more than basic competency. Best check with the venue. Most sessions start late.

## Fish and Chips

An entirely subjective, unverified list of the [Best 10 Fish and Chip shops](https://www.visitdublin.com/guides/best-fish-chips-dublin) of Dublin.

## Ancient history

The [National Museum of Ireland's Archeology collection](https://www.museum.ie/en-ie/museums/archaeology/exhibitions/or-ireland-s-gold) has a huge collection of Prehistoric, Viking era, and Early Medieval Religious objets d'art including several very fine gold hoardes.

The [Book of Kells](https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/collections/ks65hc20t?locale=en) from the fourth century is one of the finest illustrated manuscripts on display, in a library which many will know from films for it's evocative internal architecture.
