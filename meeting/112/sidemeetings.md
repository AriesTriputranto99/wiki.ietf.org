# Public Side Meetings at IETF 112

IETF participants occasionally organize side meetings around [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings) to discuss topics of interest to some portion of the IETF community. While these are side meetings, the IETF does provide this wiki to register the topics, contact persons, dates and times, and other information about the meetings being planned. This page provides details for side meetings around [IETF 112 Online](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/112/).
## Notes about public side meetings

  -  Side meetings posted here should be open for anyone to attend and are subject to the [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well). 

  -  Side meetings do not record attendance ("blue sheets") as is done during IETF working groups sessions. 

  -  Since there are many freely available conferencing services, the [IESG](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/) has decided not to provide conferencing support for side meetings. 

  -  Active consent from participants should be sought by organizers for any side meeting that is recorded. 

  -  Side meeting dates and times should be listed in UTC. For help converting time zones, please use a tool like [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html). UPDATE: For reference, IETF 111 sessions are scheduled between 12:00 and 18:00 UTC. 

If you would like to provide an .ics file for a side meeting, please put the link in the appropriate column below.
## Steps to schedule a side meeting

 1.   Please choose the day that you want to meet.
  2.  Please select the time that best accommodates your group and complete the table fields. At a minimum, please make sure to provide a meeting name, point of contact and meeting description.
 3.   Please arrange your own conferencing service and put the link in the table.
