## Transportation

- BTS Skytrain (Bangkok Mass Transit System)
- MRT System (Metropolitan Rapid Transit)
- Tuk Tuks
- Boats

The best way to get around Bangkok is by using the BTS Skytrain (Bangkok Mass Transit System) or the MRT (Metro). 

The BTS covers much of central Bangkok, including popular areas like Siam, Sukhumvit, Sathorn, and Silom. The BTS Skytrain is ideal to avoid traffic congestion, connect to major shopping centers and attractions and it is affordable (around 17-62 THB per trip). Consider purchasing a Rabbit Card for convenient, cashless travel on the BTS.

The MRT extends the reach of Bangkok’s public transport network, covering areas not served by the BTS. It is particularly useful for reaching locations like Chinatown, Chatuchak Weekend Market, and the cultural heart of Rattanakosin Island. The advantages of the MRT is that it is air-conditioned, clean, connects with the BTS at several interchange stations, and is affordable (around 16-42 THB per trip). For convenience consider using your Master or Visa to pay for the trip directly by scanning it at the turnstile. This will save you time from queuing at the ticket counter.
