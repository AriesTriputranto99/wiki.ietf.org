## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of  [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule)
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org is used for Hackathon presentations and contains repositories for some Hackathon projects.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
    * IETF Hackathon teams should upload their Hackathon project presentations to [GitHub](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf119-project-presentations).
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, see details in the [README](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf119-project-presentations/blob/main/README.md)
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before Hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}
  
## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

	- Shuisong Hu (Hi.shuisong@gmail.com)
  - Longjie Wang (whhxd@outlook.com)
  - Linzhe Li (lilz@zgclab.edu.cn)
- **Project Info**
SAV-D is a distributed defense architecture based on Source Address Validation (SAV) technology, designed to improve the effectiveness of defenses against IP spoofing DDoS attacks. It achieves this by collecting and aggregating threat data from existing SAV devices and then distributing crucial information across a broad range of devices to significantly enhance network-wide defenses. Through its innovative approach of utilizing SAV devices as honeypots to gather threat data, and sharing attack detection information and IP blocklists with victims' defense systems, SAV-D aims to bolster the overall resilience of networks against sophisticated DDoS attacks.
- **Hackathon plan**
The purpose of this hackathon is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAV-D architecture in addressing DDoS reflection amplification attacks through experimental means, and to validate the draft submitted, which describes the overall architecture of SAV-D and its workflow.

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)
- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti <saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk>
  - Gregor Haywood (remote, St Andrews, UK) <gh66@st-andrews.ac.uk>
  - Rodney Grimes <rgrimes@freebsd.org>

  - Ran Atkinson
- **Project Info**
  - <https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk>
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on IPv6.

  - Yong Cui (<cuiyong@tsinghua.edu.cn>)
- **Project Info**
	[RFC8612](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8612/) defines the DOTS (DDoS Open Threat Signaling) protocol for the collaborative response to DDoS attacks, which can be used between any devices to convey collaborative information such as mitigation requests and monitoring data. As DDoS attacks and mitigation technology have evolved, DOTS can no longer meet some of the needs for collaborative mitigation. It is necessary to extend the DOTS data model to improve the speed of collaborative response and optimize collaborative mitigation strategies. In this project, we extend the Yang Data Model for DOTS and develop a prototype system to support and evaluate the extensions.
  </n>
  Please refer to the RFC drafts listed below for more info about the extensions. Advice and comments are very welcome!

This hack implements a *Right to Know* and a *Right to be Forgotten* application for vCons. This hack identifies which vCons contain personal information about a particular person, then provides the ability to report on what that personal information is, deletes it, and provides an audit trail.
In the age of AI, the balance between the right to know and the right to be forgotten has significant implications for personal data like voice recordings. As AI technologies increasingly rely on large datasets, including voice recordings for training purposes, the right to know can support transparency about how these datasets are collected, used, and shared by organizations. This transparency is crucial for understanding and monitoring AI's impact on privacy and individual rights. 
However, the right to be forgotten plays a crucial role in empowering individuals to control their personal data, including voice recordings. Individuals can request the deletion of their voice data from databases to protect their privacy, especially in cases where the data is no longer necessary or relevant. This right is essential in preventing misuse of personal information and mitigating potential harms, such as unauthorized surveillance or identity theft.
The challenge lies in balancing these rights to ensure that AI development is both transparent and respectful of privacy. Regulations like the GDPR in the European Union provide frameworks for this, requiring clear consent for data collection and offering mechanisms for data deletion.

- **Project Info**
Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) is a new player towards autonomous
vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  An SDV is
constructed by a software platform like a cloud-native system and 
has its internal network.  To facilitate the easy and efficient 
configuration of networks in the SDV, an intent-based
management is an appropriate direction.  This project explores a
framework of intent-based management for networks, security, and
applications in SDVs so that they can communicate with other SDVs and
infrastructure nodes for safe driving and infotainment services in
the road networks.

### Dynamic Orbit Communication Protocol (DOCAP)
- **Champions**
Yoshiki Uchida (uchiyoshi@sfc.wide.ad.jp)

- **Project Info**
The Dynamic Orbital Communication Adjustment Protocol (DOCAP) optimizes space communication by using heartbeat messages from orbital nodes like spacecraft to dynamically adjust communication margins based on speed and acceleration. The protocol currently sets a fixed MAX_SPEED_MPH (the assumed maximum speed), which may not reflect actual speed variations due to orbital maneuvers. To enhance communication efficiency and reliability, DOCAP aims to dynamically update MAX_SPEED_MPH based on real-time heartbeat data, ensuring accurate communication adjustments in the dynamic space environment. These topics will be discussed during the Hackathon.
