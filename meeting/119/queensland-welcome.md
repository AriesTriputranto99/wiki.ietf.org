It is my pleasure to welcome you to the [IETF 119 Brisbane](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/119) meeting.

We know that many of you have travelled far and wide to be here today and we hope that while you’re here you are able to make the most of this world-class destination. 

We’re so happy to host you here in Australia and particularly Brisbane, where the opportunity for exploration is truly endless. Brisbane has so many incredible things on offer with so much to see and do, from delicious dining in picturesque restaurants to unique cultural experiences.

Business events represent one of the highest yielding sectors in our country’s visitor economy and that is why the Queensland Government is proud to support the IETF 119 Brisbane meeting through Tourism and Events Queensland.

Thank you for being here. We know you will find IETF 119 highly valuable and we will so gladly welcome each and every one of you back to Brisbane any time. 

The Hon. Michael Healy MP
Minister for Tourism and Sport
