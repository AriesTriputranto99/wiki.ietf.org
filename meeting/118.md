## Airport Transportation :taxi:
Václav Havel Airport Prague (PRG), formerly Prague Ruzyně International Airport, is located 10km (6 miles) west of the city center. Terminal 1 (T1) is for intercontinental flights including flights from the UK, North America, Near East, Africa, and Asia, Terminal 2 (T2) is for flights from EU countries, and Terminal 3 (T3) is for charter flights.

For transfers to/from the airport, the most expensive way is the contractual taxi service svez.se airport transport operated by TICK TACK s.r.o. Contract taxi vehicles are available 24 hours a day right in front of the arrival halls of both terminals. You can also turn to the TAXI counters located in the terminal lobbies, where you can get information about the prices and other details. You can also learn more about the rides and fares from the TAXI dispatchers outside the halls at the taxi pick-up points.

Prague has cars services - Uber and its local competitor [LiftAgo](http://www.liftago.com/). Pricing is roughly same as taxi services.

Public transportation is also available. There are two ways to get to the IETF meeting venue:

- the airport 100 Bus to the Metro B Zlicin station (take the yellow Metro B line to the Florenc Metro Station)
- the airport AE bus to the Metro C Hlavni nadrazi station (take the red Metro C line to the Florenc Metro Station) (60 Kč full adult ticket, can be bought at airport booth with creditcard)

Florenc station is a five minutes walk from IETF 118 venue.

Additionally, there is a shared ride shuttle service [Prague Airport Transfers](https://www.prague-airport-transfers.co.uk/). They take online bookings up to the day of travel. From the booking page it looks like the shared ride is roughly half the cost of a taxi. The same company will also book a private car for up to four people.

There is a page of public transport company describing [airport transfer](http://www.dpp.cz/en/public-transit-to-prague-airport/) and [transit schematics](http://www.dpp.cz/en/transport-around-prague/transit-schematics/)

## Miscellaneous Information :information_source:

[Local etiquette](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g274684-s606/Czech-Republic:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html) on tipping in restaurants: 10% is normal to tip, and even when the bill says "Service is not included" it means "the **TIP** is not included," service is always included. If you were satisfied it is common to leave around 10% tip (rounding up to some nice number when paying) but if you weren't satisfied you don't have to leave anything. If you on the other thought that the service was exceptional nothing is stopping you from leaving more.

Tipping by credit card is considered somewhat undesirable, as some establishments will take part, if not all, of a credit card based tip "for the house" rather than passing it along to the server. If you are paying by a credit card, give the server a tip when s/he returns your paying slip, or if paying by cash just round up the bill as you are paying.

[It is unnecessary to tip your Taxi driver](http://www.whototip.net/tipping-in-czech-republic). However, it is appropriate to round up the fair or add a few extra coins for exceptional service.
