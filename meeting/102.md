## Meeting Venue
**Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Montréal**, 900 René-Lévesque Blvd W, Montreal, QC H3B 4A5, Canada

The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Montréal has direct access to the Bonaventure Metro Station (on the Orange Line). There is a hotel entrance from the metro station. Please follow signage.

The hotel is located directly above Central Train Station (VIA Rail Canada). There is a hotel entrance from the train station. Please follow signage.

## Airport Transportation
**Various transportation to and from the venue and the Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL) International Airport (Aéroport international Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau de Montréal):**

**Taxis**

Taxis to and from the IETF Meeting Venue are estimated to be about CAD$40 one way, higher at rush hour.

**Uber**

Pickups are on the upper level at door 6.

**747 Express Bus**

Featuring nine stops in each direction, the 747 bus service is provided by the City of Montreal 24 hours a day, 365 days a year transportation between downtown Montréal and Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. Tickets are purchased at the cost of $10 inside the terminal before boarding (there are several ticket machines, spread in the terminal, most travellers concentrate on the one near the exit, search the others). When returning a $10 bus fare is paid aboard the bus (coins only, bills are not accepted). Tickets provide travelers with a transit pass valid on the STM bus and metro network for 24 hours. Alternatively, you can purchase a three-day ($19) transit pass which also covers the 747 bus and have transit for the beginning of your time in Montreal. (A weekly pass is probably not advantageous to IETF travelers, because it runs Monday-Sunday, does not cover the 747 bus, and requires a $6 OPUS card first.)

Starting June 19, two route options are available to you from the airport.

Destination Terminus Lionel-Groulx

- A single stop
- Travel time from 25 to 35 minutes, depending on traffic

Destination Centre-ville (downtown)

- 11 stops
- Travel time from 45 to 70 minutes, depending on traffic
- Stops at hotels on boul. René-Lévesque
- Terminus stop at Berri-UQAM métro station

To reach your destination, we suggest to take the bus named Terminus métro Lionel-Groulx. The bus driver will let you off at Lionel-Groulx métro station, a transfer station equipped with an elevator. This way, you can go on to your hotel faster (roads and highways into the city sometimes experience heavy traffic).

## Public Transportation and Area Maps
Bus and Metro are covered by either OPUS ($6, good for four years) cards or l'Occasionelle cards (free, disposable), and different passes can be loaded on each. Find the full chart here http://www.stm.info/sites/default/files/pdf/en/tarifs.pdf.

If you need public transit access the entire week, consider a combination of one- and three-day passes on l'Occasionelle cards.

## Self-tour
## Getting Around (to and from the Meeting Venue)
BIXI is Montreal's public bike share system. Pricing is $2.95/trip ($2.50 with an OPUS card), $5/day, or $25/10 trips. Each trips is up to 30 minutes and additional fees apply thereafter ($1.75 for the next 15 minutes, $3 every 15 minutes after that). Note that the day pass consists of as many one-way trips as you want, not unlimited usage, so these usage fees still apply. (However, the waiting time between trips is only one minute.) Bicycle helmets are strongly recommended, but not required. For more information, see BIXI http://montreal.bixi.com/en/pricing.

## Events
[AURA A](https://www.aurabasiliquemontreal.com/en/) luminous experience in the heart of the Basilica, very close to the conference.

[MURAL Montreal](https://muralfestival.com/en/festival/dynamic-map/) hosts an extensive amount of public wall art. Although the Mural Festival will be over long before the IETF meeting starts, you can just use their map to walk around and look at the art on your own - it is all pretty much clustered together, close to downtown. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, and cafés around if you want to make a stop. Keep in mind that not all of these murals are lit at night, so daytime is best...

## ATMs & Money Conversion
Currency in Canada is the Canadian Dollar (CAD). It is abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or sometimes Can$ or C$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. [About the Canadian Dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar). Please note: Canada no longer recognizes one cent coins (pennies) as currency. Coins are in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50 cents, as well as one dollar (loonie) and two dollars (toonie). [Banknotes are in C$5, C$10, C$20, C$50 and C$100 bills, printed on a polymer substrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_Canadian_dollar).

[Public Mobile](https://www.publicmobile.ca/en/bc/) - no-contract prepaid plans using the Telus network. You can apparently buy the cards at Wal-mart, Wow!, or K-Mobile. I can't find the latter 2 close to the venue, but there's a [Wal-mart at Côte-des-Neiges Métro station](https://www.walmart.ca/en/stores-near-me/c%c3%b4te-des-neiges-supercentre-1170) (and Bonaventure is near the Queen Elizabeth), so that would be a possibility.

## Post office
If you want to send postcards (strangely, there is no 1st-April RFC about IP over postcards), there is a post office on boulevard René-Levesque, just after the Fairmont (turn right when going outside of the hotel).
