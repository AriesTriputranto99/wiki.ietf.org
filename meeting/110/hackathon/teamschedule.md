# Team Schedule

The IETF Hackathon is taking place globally and entirely online. It is up to individual project teams to determine the preferred dates, times, and ways to meet to work on their project.

The IETF is using gather.town to facilitate social interaction at the IETF meeting. There is a space for the hackathon with tables and whiteboards that teams can use for group communication and information sharing. A URL for gather.town will be listed HERE before the start of the hackathon. You are free to use that, but you may also use Zoom, Webex, Slack, or whatever works best for your team. If you want to use Webex and need a Webex account, you can find more info [HERE](/meeting/110/hackathon).

Please fill out the table below to inform others how and when to collaborate with your team.
