# Team Schedule

As the IETF 108 Hackathon is taking place globally and entirely online, it is up to individual project teams to determine the preferred times, dates, and ways to meet to work on their project.

The IETF is experimenting with gather.town. A URL for gather.town will be listed [HERE](https://ietf.gather.town/z6N2SDxHebMdDAfo/IETF-108) on Sunday before the start of the hackathon. You are free to use that, but you may also use Zoom, Webex, Slack, or whatever works best for your project team.

Please fill out the table below to inform others how and when to collaborate with your team.

| Project name                                                         |  Date(s) and time(s), including timezone                       |  Meeting link, URL, email address, etc.                                                                                                                                                |
