## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites
### Project Teams and Champions
   * Champions are the leads for individual projects in the Hackathon
   * Champions are individuals familiar with a given technology who volunteer to help get others get up and running with that technology
   * Before the Hackathon, champions should:
      * Add information about your project to the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon)
      * Recruit participants from associated working groups, open source projects, etc. Announcing your projects via an email to (hackathon@ietf.org) can be helpful as well.
      * Specify when and how the project team will meet on the [Team Schedule](teamschedule) 
   * At the Hackathon, champions should: 
      * Make themselves available to answer questions and help others
      * Hack on things themselves in their copious free time
   * Additional projects are welcome at any time. For any questions, contact the chairs at (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
   
### Choosing a Project
   * Champions post and lead projects 
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in the list of [Projects included in Hackathon](#ProjectsIncludedinHackathon) 
   * How and when teams meet during the week is up to them and can be found in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule).
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
   
### Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the [Lost & Found](lost&found).
   
### Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs or containers
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker or something similar may be helpful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Go, Java, C++), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose

### Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * The [IETF Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub organisation is used by some of the Hackathon projects to host their repositories.
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to (hackathon-chairs@ietf.org)
     
### Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did at the end of the Hackathon.
  * Hackathon project result presentations should be uploaded to Datatracker under the specific session [Hackathon Results Presentations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/session/33500/propose_slides) at 14:00-16:00.
    * To upload your presentation, you must have a Datatracker account and be logged in.
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before the start of the Hackathon project presentations to upload your presentation, as it may be lost in the chaos.

## Network

**Access to the IETF network**
The NOC team has an ongoing experiment that allows you to join the IETF network remotely as well as at an IETF meeting venue. 

* [How to Instructions](hacknet_instructions)

Requests for networking capabilities beyond wireless access to the IETF network (e.g., wired ports, L2 access, prefix delegation) can be sent to <support@ietf.org>. 
All requests are addressed on a best effort basis. Advance notice is appreciated and improves the odds of your request being fulfilled.
{.links-list}

## <a id="Webexsessionsforteams"></a>Webex sessions for teams
Champions can request a Webex account they can use to schedule meetings for their team. These are similar to the Webex accounts allocated to working group chairs to be used for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a team champion at any time. Accounts will remain active and available for the duration of the IETF meeting. Request your account [HERE](https://www.ietf.org/forms/wg-webex-account-request/). In the request form, you can use your project name where it asks for "Working Group Name" ("Hackathon Project Name").

## Ongoing Communication

In addition to registering for the Hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the Hackathon list. It is recommended to monitor both the Hackathon wiki and the list as the Hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

Champions are welcome and encouraged to list times and mechanisms for collaborating with their team in the [Team Schedule](teamschedule). Participants can use this page to determine how and when to reach other team members. 

The Hackathon kickoff and the project results presentations can be joined via Meetecho. The Hackathon Zulip stream may be used for general and project specific communication.

* [Zulip stream](https://zulip.ietf.org/#narrow/stream/326-hackathon)
{.links-list}

## IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All Hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each open source project and each participant's organization says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the Hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

## <a id="ProjectsIncludedinHackathon"></a>Projects Included in Hackathon

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for those who are new to the IETF or new to the Hackathon. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. *. *If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a * at the end of your project name.*

### <a id="Thread"></a>Low-Power Wireless IPv6 Networking with Thread *
- **Champion**
Stuart Cheshire &lt;cheshire@apple.com&gt;

- **Thread Overview**

  [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)) is a specification for how to carry IPv6 datagrams over a mesh of low-power [IEEE 802.15.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) wireless links. [Stuart Cheshire](https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group#board&officers:~:text=Stuart%20Cheshire) gave a [brief presentation about Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DplqxrH6Xbg&t=2148s) at the [IETF 119 IAB Open meeting in Brisbane](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/proceedings#:~:text=iabopen). The [Thread specification](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#specifications) is developed and published by the [Thread Group](https://www.threadgroup.org/). There are several independent implementations of Thread, the main one being the [OpenThread open source project](https://openthread.io/).
For this Hackathon event, the goal is to introduce people to Thread and OpenThread programming. This Hackathon event is open to all — Thread Group membership is not required, though of course Thread Group members are also welcome to participate. If you plan to participate in the Thread work at the Hackathon (on-site or remotely), please add your name to the participant list. If you already have a Thread developer board and the OpenThread build environment on your laptop, please bring that. If not, we will have a few extra Thread developer boards available and we can help you get the build environment set up. For people totally new to Thread development, we have some recommendations from [Allie Clifford](/meeting/120/hackathon/Thread-Guide-Allie-Clifford) and [Ann Olivo](/meeting/120/hackathon/Thread-Guide-Ann-Olivo).
We have a list of some project ideas. Other ideas are welcome and encouraged. Please feel free to add suggestions to the project list.

- **Participants and Project Info**
  - To avoid taking up too much space on the main Hackathon page, Thread participants and projects are listed separately on the [Thread Projects page](/meeting/121/hackathon/thread-projects).

### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- **Champions**
  - Saleem Bhatti saleem@st-andrews.ac.uk
  - Rodney Grimes rgrimes@freebsd.org
  - Alistair Woodman awoodman@netdef.org

- **Participants**
  - Gregor Haywood (remote) gh66@st-andrews.ac.uk
  - Ryo Yanagida ryo@htonl.net

- **Project Info**
  - https://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
  - RFCs 6740(E) - 6748(E)
  - The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an IP Address and replace it with addressing using a separate Locator and Identifier values, a pairing of which forms an Identifier-Locator Vector (ILV). Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our ongoing research demonstration is based on realising ILNP on IPv6.

- **Project Info**
Purpose is to make use of PQ in real world X.509 structures like keys, signatures, certificates and protocols. This will allow us to test interoperability between different algorithm implementations, gain experience using these new algorithms, and provide feedback to the standards groups about practical usage in the real world.
A good starting place is our Github repository: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates

For information on OIDs used to create interoperable structures, consult: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md

At IETF 121, we plan to update the artifact repository to support the FIPS 203, 204 and 205 algorithm standards as well as updates to the Certificate Mechanisms for transitioning to PQ. 
There is also interest in setup and testing the use of hybrid certificates for the TLSv1.3 protocol. The goal of the experiment is to explore different options for efficient use of hybrid certificates' and their multiple signature keys in the TLS protocol. We are looking for collaborations and ideas that can be then brought forward within the IETF and other standardization bodies (e.g., X9, ISO, etc.).

### Automatic DNS Delegation Synchronization Using DNS UPDATE
- **Champions**
  - Johan Stenstam (johan.stenstam@internetstiftelsen.se)
- **Project Info**
Add new functionality to a working open source nameserver implementation (called "TDNS", written in Go) to
provide fully automatic management of delegation information between child zones (both
DNSSEC-signed and unsigned) and parent zones.

This time we will look at implementing a new EDNS(0) option called KeyState (see the keystate draft below) which will be used to augment the communication between child and parent to allow more detailed expression of the state of the SIG(0) keys used for signing and validating DNS UPDATEs.

This is a continuation of the work we did during the IETF 119 and 120 Hackathons.

"SCHC Interoperability" addresses the current challenges between three SCHC protocol implementations: OpenSCHC in Python, cSCHC in C, and the recently open-sourced [Lab.SCHC](https://lab-schc.fr/) FullSDK for embedded devices. Interoperability issues exist due to missing features in OpenSCHC and differences in rule formats. This hackathon project aims to implement the missing features and develop tools to ensure seamless operation between implementations, enabling cross-platform compatibility and facilitating the adoption of SCHC-based IoT networks.

- **Project Info**
Following-up from the IETF-120 Hackathon “Exploring Implementation Approaches for Merkle Tree Ladder Mode Signatures for DNSSEC” [4], we would like to do interoperability experiments with MTL Mode [1] validation at the recursive resolver using the “request / retry” or “flag” approach in the MTL considerations draft [2].  This will be initially expressed as the SOA lookup approach in the appendix of the MTL DNSSEC draft [3] while we work towards the full EDNS option implementation from the draft.  This configuration allows us to validate our initial assumptions on the average endurance [5] of a reference value that would be sent to a requester in MTL mode and the query/response sizes. We would also like to collect further feedback from the resolver community and setup for additional proof-of-concept implementations in other code bases and collect overall operational experience.

- **Hackathon plan**
  	- The project has started at IETF120 Hackathon, where we focused on generic topology queries and addressed subset of gaps we identified for RFC8345 using IS-IS scenario in the operator LAB
	- The objective for this hackathon is to improve the IETF120 Hackathon prototype, including:
 		- More advanced way of how to retrieve performance metrics or configuration attributes (defined in RFC9030 or RFC9129 and retrieved via device API) northbound from the Controller via RFC8345 API and its IS-IS and OSPF Augmentation.
		- Start addressing simulation/emulation scenario.
