## Meeting Venue
Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown
Philadelphia, USA

## Airport Transportation
- [Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)](https://www.phl.org/))
- [Taxis and Limousines](https://www.phl.org/to-and-from/taxis-and-limousines)
- [Public Transportation](https://www.phl.org/to-and-from/public-transportation) The SEPTA Airport Line train runs from each airport terminal to the city center. The closest stop on the Airport Line to the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown is Suburban Station (one stop past the 30th Street Station) - the trip takes about 25 minutes. From there, it is about a six-minute walk to the hotel (0.3 miles). [SEPTA Airport Line Schedule](/meeting/114)https://septa.org/schedules/rail/w/AIR_0.htm) - first train leaves the Airport at 5:07am (arrives at Suburban Station 5:35am). Last train leaves the airport at 12:07am (arrives at Suburban Station 12:35am). Paper ticket (Quick Trip) is $6.75 from ticket machine or $8.00 on train at all times. Quick Trip paper tickets are valid only on day of purchase.

Note: July 23 and 24 - No direct airport train service to/from Center City (Suburban, Jefferson, or Temple University Stations) [SEPTA](https://www.septa.org/southwestconnection/). It seems like they're suggesting that you can take the train from the airport to 30th St Station, and then get a second train from 30th St to Suburban/Jefferson/Temple. "For continuing travel to Center City from 30th Street: take any Regional Rail train going towards Suburban Station or use Market Frankford Line/Trolleys - 30th Street (across from Amtrak Station)." On these days, airport trains use the lower level (Amtrak) platforms at 30th St, so one can walk to the upper level (Regional Rail) platforms for trains to Center City.

## Train
If you are traveling from nearby cities (such as Washington DC or NYC), it may be faster to take the train. Philadelphia is served by Amtrak and NJ Transit Rail (Atlantic City Line) through the 30th Street Station. From the 30th Street Station, it is about a 20-minute walk to the hotel. Suburban Station (closest train station to the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown) is one stop away from 30th Street station, which is a major hub. From 30th Street Station the venue is a very short taxi ride - about 0.9 miles.

Amtrak tickets to/from 30th Street Station include same day local train (SEPTA regional rail, not subway) [between 30th Street and Suburban Stations](https://www.septa.org/fares/ticket/index.html) (details at bottom of linked page).

## Electricity, Power, and Outlet
[Electric plug, outlet, and voltage information for USA](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/united-states-of-america/)

## Staying Safe
Philadelphia is a big city, some call it a "City of Neighborhoods". As with any urban area, there exists some level of crime in all areas. Please beware of your surroundings and please be mindful that you can go from a safe to less-safe neighborhood in just a couple of blocks. Understand where you're going, and how you'll get there. Information on local crime is published by the Philadelphia police at https://www.phillypolice.com/crime-maps-stats/. The Philadelphia Inquirer also published crime data, available at https://data.philly.com/philly/crime/

Homeless people live in the general area of the venue, and they may approach you to ask for money or food.

There is also a trend of motorbikes exhibitioning on the parkway. They may pop wheelies and run stop lights. They are loud, and easily avoided. If you hear them coming down the street, please stay on the sidewalk.

Do your best to stay on major sidewalks, avoiding smaller/dimmer alleys as best as possible.

## COVID Measures
