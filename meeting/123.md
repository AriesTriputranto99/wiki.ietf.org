## Airport Transportation :airplane:

Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD) is operated by AENA, being the bigger one in Spain, 2nd in Europe, and 14th in the world. It has 4 main terminals, which distribute the flights among different airline alliances.

The bigger and most modern terminal, the T4, concentrates all the flights from the Oneworld alliance, and has a Satellite terminal (T4S), for all the non-Schengen flights.

The official AENA website with all the airport information is (http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/index.html).

The 4 main terminals are interconnedted by free shuttle bus, information at (https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/transport-between-terminals.html).

AENA is the national operator for Spanish and many international airports. You can register for free in their Club (https://clubcliente.aena.es/AenaClub/en/) to obtain free services and discounts within the airports network.

An alternative non-official website is available at (https://www.aeropuertomadrid-barajas.com/eng/).

Depending on what terminal you're landing, there are several transport options to reach the venue

There are different bus lines, metro and train. Google Maps offers very good information of all the choices.

- Metro (recommented, faster & cheaper, unless you prefer a taxi)
- Cercanías Train
- Bus
- Taxi

The most efficient method to reach the IETF venue from the Madrid Airport is by Taxi or rideshare service. If you are looking for a more immersive and cost-effective travel method, you can take the local Metro, Train, or Bus system.

If you plan to use the public transport around Madrid, it is recommended to purchase 10-trips or a Multi Public Transport Card for 30 days, which can be just Metro, Bus, Cercanías Train, or combinations of them, so you can save more as much as you use it. All the information available at the Metro web site (https://www.metromadrid.es/en).

In addition to that, there is also a Tourist Card with unlimited traveling, with different options regarding the number of days (and can be further recharged afterwards), which can be purchased at any of the airport terminals. Information available at (https://www.crtm.es/billetes-y-tarifas/otras-tarjetas/turistica/?lang=en).

### Metro :metro:

The Madrid Airport is connected to the city of Madrid via the Pink Metro Line 8 (https://www.metromadrid.es/en/linea/linea-8). This line ends at the Nuevos Ministerios Station, where you would need to transfer to the dark Blue Metro Line 10 (https://www.metromadrid.es/en/linea/linea-10), direction "Hospital Infanta Sofia". The closer station to the Meliá Castilla is "Cuzco" (5 minutes walking to the Melíá Castilla), just 2 stations from Nuevos Ministerios.

The total journey is estimated to be about 40-45 minutes in travel time and will cost 4.50€.

The airport has two metro stations; one at Terminal 2 (T2), floor 1, and the other one at Terminal 4 (T4), floor -1. Both are part of the pink line 8. These lines run 06:00 to 01:30.

### Cercanías Train :train:

Madrid Airport is served by the train line C-1 (light blue), located in Aeropuerto Terminal 4 (T4), floor -1. Take the C1 (light blue) line to the Madrid Chamartin Train Station where you will transfer to the Metro dark Blue Line 10 to the venue (direction Puerta del Sur, stop at Cuzco Station).

You can also use at Madrid Chamartin the Metro light Blue Line 1 direction Valdecarros, stop just at the next Station Plaza de Castilla and walk to ve Meliá Castilla (10 minutes).

Cercanias train tickets are about 2.60€ for a one-way trip and 5.20€ for a return one and can be purchased by the station’s automatic vendors. When buying a ticket, you must use it during the next 2 hours, while the return ticket is valid until the next day. Expect about 45 minutes of travel time including transfers.

Complete information about the Cercanias network at their site (https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/suburban-madrid).

### Bus :bus:

There is bus service from the airport to Madrid Center, however if you're staying at the Meliá Castilla,is not the best option, even if you will be directly connected to the Metro, or other buses.

Nonetheless, the bus network (EMT) in Madrid is very extensive, and it can be useful specially if you get a Public Transport Card. Information about the buses is available at the EMT site (https://www.emtmadrid.es/Bloques-EMT/Aeropuerto.aspx?lang=en-GB).

The most complete information of all the coordinated transports is offered by the CRTM (Consorcio de Transportes de Madrid) at their web site (https://www.crtm.es/tu-transporte-publico/?lang=en).

### Taxi & Rideshare :taxi:

Madrid airport taxis are white taxi vehicles, with red stripes and the city’s emblem on their sides. They are lined up at the airport taxi ranks, no matter the time or day. Each terminal is equipped with two taxi ranks, one at the departures and one at the arrivals level, while passengers are highly advised to hire their cabs exclusively from the official ranks to avoid getting overcharged. 

Madrid taxis are metered. However, the ride from the airport to the Hotel or City Center is set at 35€, even if the transfer takes place during the night or on public holidays. Additionally, luggage isn’t an extra charge. The travel time is about 20-30 minutes, however, could spike up to 40-50 during peak traffic hours. 

Uber, Cabify and Bolt are rideshare services offered in Madrid. The rideshare station at the Madrid Airport is located in the designated passenger pick-up area outside the airport labeled, "TNC/Rideshares."
