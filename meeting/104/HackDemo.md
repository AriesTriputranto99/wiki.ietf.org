# IETF 104 Hackdemo Happy Hour!
Room: [Chez Louis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/104/floor-plan?room=chez-louis)

Join us for an in depth look at some of the great projects from the IETF Hackathon. This is your opportunity to meet with the teams behind the projects and get answers to any and all of the questions you may have about what they did, how they did it, and the impact it has on work going on at the IETF.

The Hackdemo Happy Hour will take place on Monday, March 25 from 18:30 to 20:00. Snacks will be provided and a cash bar will be available.

Hackathon teams are welcome and encouraged to add their project by entering the project name/acronym and a contact name and email address in the table below.
