### Remote participation
- Participating in person is preferred, but we understand not everyone can travel. If you want to participate remotely, please contact the champion(s) of the project to determine how best to coordinate.
- Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org
- Meetecho: http://ietf104.conf.meetecho.com/
### IPR and Code Contribution Guideline
All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules.

	- Eduardo InglÃ©s SÃ¡nchez <eduardo.ingles at um.es>
- Project(s)
	- EAP-NOOB is an EAP method where the authentication is based on a user-assisted out-of-band (OOB) channel between the server and peer.
	- It is a generic bootstrapping solution for Internet-of-Things devices which have no pre-configured authentication credentials and which are not yet registered on the authentication server. Consider devices you just bought or borrowed.
	- EAP-NOOB draft: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-aura-eap-noob-04
	- EAP-NOOB Implementation: https://github.com/tuomaura/eap-noob
	- During the hackathon, we plan to work on the following:
	- Bug fixes
		- New OOB channels such as NFC and audio
		- Testing of new Reconnect Exchange
### DNS

- Champion(s)
	- Petr Å paÄek <petr.spacek at nic dot cz>
- Project(s)
	- Common configuration interface for DNS - YANG. Cross DNS server manageability may significantly benefit from alignment on some baseline formal modeling approach. The combo if NETCONF protocol with YANG modeling was designed and in the meantime also is proven to work well in many configuration contexts - and might prove beneficial also for management of DNS servers and/or services. The hackathon project provides a prove of the concept
	- For more details, hackathon results summary and contact to the contributors please see  IETF_104_hackathon_DNS%20-comon-config-dns-yang-v12.pdf
- DNSTAP over CBOR. Today DNSTAP messages are delivered using protobuf encapsulated over fstrm, this project will try to use CBOR (RFC 7049) instead of protobuf but still use fstrm for the encapsulation and implement this in both sending (authoritative, resolver) and receiving (dnscap, dsc etc) software. Gist of CDDL example: https://gist.github.com/jelu/46d780709047c9c756dba3c5785e7820
- Brainstorm/hack around DNSTAP and usage of fstrm, current common implementation is that the DNS server software connect out to a fstrm/DNSTAP listener, would also be nice to be able to connect to the DNS server and get the DNSTAP when needed
- Implementing draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error on Knot Resolver (and may be kdig) (StÃ©phane Bortzmeyer, VladimÃ­r ÄunÃ¡t)
### Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP)

- Champion(s)
	- Saleem Bhatti < saleem at st-andrews.ac.uk>

	- RFC6740 / RFC6741 / RFC6742 / RFC6743 / RFC6744 / RFC6745 / RFC6746 / RFC6747 / RFC6748 (Status: Experimental)
	- The [ILNP_project](http://ilnp.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) is enhancing the Internet Architecture by enriching the set of namespaces. The basic approach to this is to deprecate the concept of an Address and replace it with separate Locator and Identifier values. Although the architectural concept is independent of any particular network protocol, our research demonstration will be based on IPv6.

### Homenet, DNSSD and the Internet of Things

- Champions
	- Ted Lemon <mellon @fugue.com>
	- Stuart Cheshire <cheshire @apple.com>
- Projects (this ambitious, and we probably won't do all of it, but these would all be good things to work on if there is interest):
	- Turnkey homenet build of OpenWRT
	- If the Turris folks are down, it would be nice if they could join us and make it work in Turris OS as well.
	- Homenet-wide service discovery using the DNSSD Discovery proxy weâve been working on, which is fully functional at this point.
	- Support for DNSSD SRP (this would involve finishing the SRP gateway Iâve been working on, and getting it to update Unbound or BIND).
	- Joining constrained-network edge routers to homenet routing and service discovery infrastructure
	- MUD support for devices that are not on a separate link, but are isolated from nodes that donât have permission to talk to them. This should be doable in OpenWRT.
	- Automatic IKEv2 tunnels on OpenWRT that use the new split DNS stuff being published in IPSECME to allow us to serve home.arpa to VPN clients.
