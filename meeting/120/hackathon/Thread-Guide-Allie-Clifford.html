<p>Thread development recommendations from Allie Clifford.</p>
<p>Newer users<br>- Dev boards<br>-- For FTDs/MTDs:<br>---- ESP32-C6-DevKitC // comes in two flavors, 8 MB flash and 4 MB flash.&nbsp;<br>The 8MB flash version is 10$ here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5672">https://www.adafruit.com/product/5672</a><br>I have only played with the 8MB board so cant speak to the 4MB flavor (I also cant seem to find a link for one that is reasonably priced). Very easy to get going with the esp-matter SDK and also&nbsp;<br><br>----&nbsp;ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 - 4 MB Flash&nbsp;//&nbsp;This can be programmed as an FTD/MTD or RCP, is 10$ here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5715">https://www.adafruit.com/product/5715</a><br><br>-- For BRs:<br>---&nbsp;ESP THREAD BR-ZIGBEE GW // this has an H2 and an S3 chip,&nbsp;its $10 here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP%2520THREAD%2520BR-ZIGBEE%2520GW/21292142">https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP%2520THREAD%2520BR-ZIGBEE%2520GW/21292142</a></p>
<p>You can also get a daughter card to include sub ethernet for an extra 8$ I was only able to find it on sale on amazon here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C89J43LN?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C89J43LN?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details</a>&nbsp;<br>This was also very easy to get up and running immediately out of the box, highly recommend&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Tooling/building/docs etc:&nbsp;<br>All espressif dev boards use the esp-idf:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf">https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf</a><br>Its a very nice tool, plus one or two other repos depending on application layer.&nbsp;<br>-- For Matter+Thread:<br><a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter">https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter</a><br><br>-- For just Thread:&nbsp;<br>BR SDK: <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-br">https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-br</a><br>General thread libs: <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-lib">https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-lib</a><br><br>--&nbsp;There is tons and tons of ESP support in the Rust embedded ecosystem too, so if you want to encourage attendees to consider integrating Rust into their projects (which I think you should!)&nbsp;you can skip using the esp-idf and use cargo for configuring/building/flashing (it is possible to use esp-idf as outlined here: <a href="https://github.com/espressif/rust-esp32-example">https://github.com/espressif/rust-esp32-example</a> but they recommend cargo now). Here are some links for anyone interested in using rust with esp boards:<br><a href="https://github.com/esp-rs">https://github.com/esp-rs</a><br><a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-openthread">https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-openthread</a> (only supports MTDs right now but still this is awesome!!!)<br><a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal">https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal</a><br><a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal">https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal</a><br>esp-rs can be used with the embassy framework (which is a really cool project) that could easily be used to implement SSH functionality on top of: <a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy">https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy</a> (or just generally could be useful to give attendees some ideas of what they can do with an esp board&nbsp;+ rust) which has an async network stack already available / ready for use <a href="https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/">https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;And also a nice "getting started with no_std and embedded rust with ESP32" (although this is for the ESP32-C3 not the C6) :&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/no_std-training">https://github.com/esp-rs/no_std-training</a>&nbsp;<br><br>For more advanced users:<br>- Silabs dev boards<br>There are a number of silabs dev boards with thread/zigbee support but probably the easiest/quickest way to get started with these more advanced options is to use the one that is used in thread cert, because the fw images are already built &amp; available and the test harness guide has all the steps needed and all the sw dependencies defined that are needed to program these dongles as either FTD/MTD or as an RCP dongle+RPI. The one cert uses is the&nbsp;Thunderboard Sense 2, BRD4166A REV C (also listed in cert harness catalogue as XG12-DK4166C / SLTB004A/C) . There's also an openthread codelab in which any of the MG12, MG13, or MG21 series can be used (here <a href="https://openthread.io/codelabs/silabs-openthread-hardware#1">https://openthread.io/codelabs/silabs-openthread-hardware#1</a>). A seasoned person familiar with simplicity studio can probably also easily work with the MG24 or MG27 dev boards also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these are very nice dev boards in general they are also the pricey-est of all the ones I have worked with. And simplicity studio can be its own learning curve so its lowest on my list of recs.&nbsp;<br><br>- Nordic dev boards<br>The nordic dongle that I have experience with / that is used in thread cert is the nRF52840-Dongle. Its&nbsp;very straightforward&nbsp;to&nbsp;use/program, its also very cheap and easy to get in bulk. Thread cert also has all the needed steps/sw dependencies and the fw images to program these as stand alone FTD/MTDs or as an RCP with an RPI. And openthread has this nice how-to as well: <a href="https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-hardware#2">https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-hardware#2</a>&nbsp;which also has links to tools needed to program these dongles</p>
<p>The embassy project I linked above also can be used with nordic boards, theres&nbsp;a 15.4 radio driver implemented here&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/main/embassy-nrf/src/radio/ieee802154.rs">https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/main/embassy-nrf/src/radio/ieee802154.rs</a> plus loads of examples:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/examples/nrf52840/src/bin">https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/examples/nrf52840/src/bin</a>&nbsp;<br><br>More Rust plugs:<br>Both espressif and nordic dev boards have very robust support in Rust, both with std and no_std support. If you are hoping folks will work on building SSH functionality, there are some really nice minimal (no_std) Rust implementations of SSH for example this excellent one that is both no_std and uses async i/o: <a href="https://github.com/TomCrypto/zssh">https://github.com/TomCrypto/zssh</a>&nbsp;<br>And in general, embedded dev in Rust is the best!</p>
