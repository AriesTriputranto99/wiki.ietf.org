-------
## Participant Preparation and Prerequisites

* Choosing a Project
   * Champions will have table signs on the center of their table identifying their project and be available to answer questions at the start and throughout the hackathon
   * Optionally, champions may create and display posters on flip charts with additional information on their project
   * Details on each project and links to additional information for each project are in this wiki in the "Projects Included in Hackathon" section
   * Familiarity with technology area(s) in which you plan to participate will certainly help
   * It is perfectly fine, even encouraged, to work on multiple projects 
* Lost & Found
   *  Participants looking for a team and champions wanting help on their projects are encouraged to visit the Lost & Found.
* Development Environment
   * Bring a laptop on which you are comfortable developing software
   * Some projects may require installing additional software or make use of VMs
   * Installing and becoming familiar with !VirtualBox, Vagrant, or something similar will help
   * Note to champions: if planning to make use of VMs, please bring on USB drives to make available to others as download times can be painful
   * Specific coding languages are called out by some projects (e.g. Python, Java), but this is heavily dependent on the project(s) you choose
* Sharing Code
   * Git/GitHub is commonly used for open source projects. Familiarizing yourself with it is recommended.
   * An online tutorial is available here: [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
   * [IETF Hackathon GitHub Org](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon)
     * If you would like to have your project/code hosted here, send your GitHub ID and the name of your project via email to Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com
* Training Materials
   * Network programmability based on IETF standard protocols and models is relevant to many projects. Self paced online training modules are available on Cisco DevNet. Access is free but a !DevNet account is required. You can login or create an account quickly with this IETF Hackathon specific link [IETF 107 Hackathon](https://developer.cisco.com/join/ietf107)
      * [Intro to Coding Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/fundamentals )
      * [REST API Fundamentals](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/rest-api-fundamentals) 
      * [Introduction to Model Driven Programmability (YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF)](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)

   * Champions for each technology are encouraged to share any other things they think would be helpful in preparation for the hackathon
* Project Presentations
  * All teams have the opportunity to present what they did on Sunday afternoon at the end of the hackathon
    * [https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf107-project-presentations] is for IETF hackathon participants to upload their hackathon project presentations
    * You must be a member of the [IETF-Hackathon](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon) GitHub org to upload a new presentation or update/replace an existing presentation
    * To be added as a member, email Charles Eckel: eckelcu@cisco.com your GitHub ID at your earliest convenience
    * DO NOT WAIT until just before hackathon project presentations start or your request may be lost in the chaos


-------

## Network and Power
* Network
   * Wireless access to the IETF network will be provided, and from there to the outside world
   * The IETF network will be dual stack with both IPv6 and IPv4
   * Wired access to the IETF network is available by request only
   * For wired access, static IP addresses, or any other special network requests, please add your name, email address, and details of your request in the **Requests** section below.
* Power
   * There will be two power strips per table (roughly one outlet per person/seat). If you need additional power for your project/team, please add your name, email address, and details of your request in the **Requests** section below.
* Requests
   * Saleem Bhatti <saleem at st-andrews.ac.uk> : ILNP : a routable /60 if possible, please! 
   * Michael Richardson, MUD/ANIMA/HOMENET table needs wired networking, extra power bar, and would like DHCPv6-PD.
   * Michael Richardson, SUIT/TEEP/RATS table needs wired networking, extra power, and would like to be near MUD/ANIMA table, but too many to share a table

### Remote participation

Participating in person is preferred, but we understand not everyone can travel. We typically have a number of remote participants and even some projects that are championed remotely. Successful remote participation requires a bit more preparation by remote participants and champions of projects with remote participants. 

In addition to [registering](https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf107/hackathonregistration.py) for the hackathon and [subscribing](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hackathon) to the hackathon list, it is recommended to monitor both the hackathon wiki and the list as the hackathon approaches, determine which project(s) are of interest to you, and reach out to the champions of those projects to determine how best to be involved and coordinate with the rest of the team working on each project.

The hackathon kickoff and the closing presentations are available via Meetecho. The hackathon Jabber room may be used for general and project specific communication.
* Jabber room: xmpp:hackathon@jabber.ietf.org
* Meetecho: http://ietf107.conf.meetecho.com/


### IPR and Code Contribution Guideline

All hackathon participants are free to work on any code. The rules regarding that code are what each participant's organization and/or open source project says they are. The code itself is not an IETF Contribution. However, discussions, presentations, demos, etc., during the hackathon are IETF Contributions (similar to Contributions made in working group meetings). Thus, the usual IETF policies apply to these Contributions, including copyright, license, and IPR disclosure rules. 

-------
## Projects Included in Hackathon (add your project using the template provided at end of project list)

* Note, all projects are open to everyone. However, some champions have identified their projects as being particularly good for first time IETFers and/or first time hackathoners. These projects are marked with a star, i.e. '*'. If you are championing a project that is great for newcomers, please add a '*' at the end of your project name.

### LPWAN SCHC header compression and fragmentation
   * Champion(s)
       * Laurent Toutain (IMT Atlantique) laurent dot toutain at imt dash atlantique dot fr
       * [REMOTE] Cedric Adjih (INRIA) cedric dot adjih at inria dot fr
       * Shoichi Sakane (Cisco) ssakane at cisco dot com
       * [REMOTE] Olivier Gimenez (Semtech) ogimenez at semtech dot com
       * [REMOTE] Dominique Barthel (Orange Labs) dominique dot barthel at orange dot com
     * Project(s)
       * **Interop testing** between several implementations.
         - We will provide a set of Rules (in the openSCHC format), that you can convert into your own representation before the Hackathon.
           We will provide test packets as text files containing JSON hex string.
         - A first test will be that some packets are compressed and compared to the known SCHC Packet output.
           Some SCHC Packets are decompressed and compared to the known packet output.
           Each implementation can perform this test independently of the others. 
         - A second test is to interconnect two implementations in real time, and to compare the decompressed output with the original packet (before compression).
           This allows for some degree of random testing. The direct communication between two implementations will use UDP sockets.
         - If time permits, the No-ACK mode of fragmentation can be tested the same way as compression:
           first with test vectors, second with direct unidirectional communication between two implementations.
       * for documentation about SCHC, see
         * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/
         * and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc/
       * Other goals can be to advance the python open source implementation of SCHC compression and fragmentation. See openschc.net        
         * improve the tutorial. In general, make it easier for a newcomer to join the project and contribute.
