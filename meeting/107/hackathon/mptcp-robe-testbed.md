  1.  MPTCP RobE draft-amend-mptcp-robe-01 is a set of extensions to regular MPTCP RFC6824 and its next upcoming version draft-ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis. It is designed to provide a more Robust Establishment (RobE) of MPTCP sessions. 

 2.   RobE includes RobE_TIMER, RobE_SIM, RobE_eSIM and RobE_IPS. It also presents the design and protocol procedure for the combination scenario in addition to these stand-alone solutions, i.e. the combination of RobE_SIM and RobE_IPS, the combination of RobE_TIMER and RobE_IPS.
